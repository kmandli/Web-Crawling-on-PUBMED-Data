'''Cholesterol''' (from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''chole-'' ([[bile]]) and ''stereos'' (solid), followed by the [[chemical]] [[suffix]] ''-ol'' for an [[alcohol]]) is an [[organic compound|organic]] [[molecule]]. It is a [[sterol]] (or [[chemical modification|modified]] [[steroid]]),<ref>{{MeshName|Cholesterol|2013}}</ref> a type of [[lipid]] molecule, and is [[biosynthesis|biosynthesized]] by all animal [[Cell (biology)#Eukaryotic cells|cells]], because it is an essential structural component of all [[animal]] [[cell membrane]]s and is essential to maintain both membrane structural integrity and [[membrane fluidity|fluidity]]. Cholesterol allows animal cells to function without a [[cell wall]] (which in other species protects membrane integrity and cell viability); this allows animal cells to change shape rapidly.

In addition to its importance for animal cell structure, cholesterol also serves as a [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] for the biosynthesis of [[steroid hormone]]s, [[bile acid]]<ref name="Hanukoglu_1992">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanukoglu I | title = Steroidogenic enzymes: structure, function, and role in regulation of steroid hormone biosynthesis. | journal = J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol | volume = 43 | issue = 8 | pages = 779–804 | date = Dec 1992 | pmid = 22217824 | doi = 10.1016/0960-0760(92)90307-5 }}</ref> and [[vitamin D]]. Cholesterol is the principal [[sterol]] synthesized by all animals. In [[vertebrate]]s, [[liver|hepatic]] cells typically produce the greatest amounts. It is absent among [[prokaryote]]s ([[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]), although there are some exceptions, such as ''[[Mycoplasma]]'', which require cholesterol for growth.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Razin S, Tully JG | title = Cholesterol Requirement of Mycoplasmas | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 102 | issue = 2 | pages = 306–310 | date = May 1970 | pmid = 4911537 | pmc = 247552 }}</ref>

[[François Poulletier de la Salle]] first identified cholesterol in solid form in [[gallstone]]s in 1769. However, it was not until 1815 that chemist [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]] named the compound "cholesterine".<ref>Chevreul (1816) "Recherches chimiques sur les corps gras, et particulièrement sur leurs combinaisons avec les alcalis.

==Physiology==
Since cholesterol is essential for all animal life, each cell is capable of synthesizing it by way of a complex 37-step process, beginning with the [[mevalonate pathway]] and ending with a 19-step conversion of [[lanosterol]] to cholesterol.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}  Furthermore, it can be absorbed directly from animal-based foods.

A human male weighing 68&nbsp;kg (150&nbsp;lb) normally synthesizes about 1 gram (1,000&nbsp;mg) per day, and his body contains about 35 g, mostly contained within the cell membranes. Typical daily cholesterol dietary intake for a man in the United States is 307&nbsp;mg.<ref name="cdc-calories">{{cite web | title = National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey | publisher = United States Center for Disease Control | url = https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/databriefs/calories.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate = 2012-01-28}}
</ref>

Most ingested cholesterol is [[esterified]], and esterified cholesterol is poorly absorbed. The body also compensates for any absorption of additional cholesterol by reducing cholesterol synthesis.<ref>
{{cite journal | vauthors = Lecerf JM, de Lorgeril M | title = Dietary cholesterol: from physiology to cardiovascular risk | journal = Br J Nutr | volume = 106 | issue = 1 | pages = 6–14 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21385506 | doi = 10.1017/S0007114511000237 }}</ref> For these reasons, cholesterol in food, seven to ten hours after ingestion, has little, if any effect on concentrations of cholesterol in the blood. However, during the first seven hours after ingestion of cholesterol, as absorbed fats are being distributed around the body within extracellular water by the various [[lipoprotein]]s (which transport all fats in the water outside cells), the concentrations increase.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dubois C, Armand M, Mekki N, Portugal H, Pauli AM, Bernard PM, Lafont H, Lairon D | title = Effects of increasing amounts of dietary cholesterol on postprandial lipemia and lipoproteins in human subjects | journal = Journal of Lipid Research | volume = 35 | issue = 1994 | pages = 1993–2007 | date = 1994 | pmid = 7868978 }}</ref> It is also important to recognize, however, that the concentrations measured in the samples of blood plasma vary with the measurement methods used. Traditional, cheaper methods do not reflect (a) which lipoproteins are transporting the various fat molecules, nor (b) which cells are ingesting, burning or exporting the fat molecules being measured as totals from samples of blood plasma.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Cholesterol is recycled in the body. The [[liver]] excretes it in a non-esterified form (via bile) into the digestive tract. Typically, about 50% of the excreted cholesterol is reabsorbed by the [[small intestine]] back into the bloodstream.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Function===
Cholesterol, given that it composes about 30% of all animal cell membranes, is required to build and maintain [[Cell membrane|membranes]] and modulates [[membrane fluidity]] over the range of physiological temperatures. The [[hydroxyl]] group on cholesterol interacts with the [[Polar molecules|polar]] heads of the [[lipid bilayer|membrane]] [[phospholipid]]s and [[sphingolipid]]s, while the bulky [[steroid]] and the [[hydrocarbon]] chain are embedded in the membrane, alongside the [[Polar molecules#Nonpolar molecules|nonpolar]] [[Fatty acid|fatty-acid chain]] of the other lipids. Through the interaction with the phospholipid fatty-acid chains, cholesterol increases membrane packing, which both alters membrane fluidity<ref name="isbn1-4292-4646-4">{{cite book |vauthors=Sadava D, Hillis DM, Heller HC, Berenbaum MR | title = Life: The Science of Biology 9th Edition | publisher = Freeman | location = San Francisco | year = 2011 | pages = 105–114 | isbn = 1-4292-4646-4 }}</ref> and maintains membrane integrity so that animal cells do not need to build cell walls (like plants and most bacteria). The membrane remains stable and durable without being rigid, allowing animal cells to change shape and animals to move.

The structure of the tetracyclic ring of cholesterol contributes to the fluidity of the cell membrane, as the molecule is in a ''trans'' conformation making all but the side chain of cholesterol rigid and planar.<ref name="Ohvo-Rekilä_2002">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ohvo-Rekilä H, Ramstedt B, Leppimäki P, Slotte JP | title = Cholesterol interactions with phospholipids in membranes | journal = Prog.

Within the cell membrane, cholesterol also functions in intracellular transport, cell signaling and nerve conduction. Cholesterol is essential for the structure and function of invaginated [[caveolae]] and [[clathrin]]-coated pits, including caveola-dependent and clathrin-dependent [[endocytosis]]. The role of cholesterol in endocytosis of these types can be investigated by using [[methyl beta cyclodextrin]] (MβCD) to remove cholesterol from the plasma membrane. Recent studies show that cholesterol is also implicated in cell signaling processes, assisting in the formation of [[lipid raft]]s in the [[plasma membrane]], which brings receptor proteins in close proximity with high concentrations of second messenger molecules.<ref name="Incardona_2000">{{cite journal | vauthors = Incardona JP, Eaton S | title = Cholesterol in signal transduction | journal = Curr.

</ref> In multiple layers, cholesterol and phospholipids, both electrical insulators, can facilitate speed of transmission of electrical impulses along nerve tissue.

Within cells, cholesterol is also a precursor molecule for several biochemical pathways. For example, it is the precursor molecule for the synthesis of [[vitamin D]] and all [[steroid hormones]], including the [[adrenal gland]] hormones [[cortisol]] and [[aldosterone]], as well as the sex hormones [[progesterone]], [[estrogen]]s, and [[testosterone]], and their derivatives.<ref name="Hanukoglu_1992" /><ref name="Payne_2004">{{cite journal | vauthors = Payne AH, Hales DB | title = Overview of steroidogenic enzymes in the pathway from cholesterol to active steroid hormones | journal = Endocrine Reviews | volume = 25 | issue = 6 | pages = 947–70 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15583024 | doi = 10.1210/er.2003-0030 }}</ref>

The liver excretes cholesterol into [[bile|biliary]] fluids, which is then stored in the [[gallbladder]]. Bile contains bile salts, which solubilize fats in the digestive tract and aid in the intestinal absorption of fat molecules as well as the fat-soluble vitamins, [[Vitamin A|A]], [[Vitamin D|D]], [[Vitamin E|E]], and [[Vitamin K|K]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Biosynthesis===
All animal cells manufacture cholesterol, for both membrane structure and other uses, with relative production rates varying by cell type and organ function. About 80% of total daily cholesterol production occurs in the [[liver]]; other sites of higher synthesis rates include the [[intestines]], [[adrenal gland]]s, and [[reproductive organ]]s.

Synthesis within the body starts with the [[mevalonate pathway]] where two molecules of [[acetyl CoA]] condense to form [[acetoacetyl-CoA]]. This is followed by a second condensation between [[acetyl CoA]] and [[acetoacetyl-CoA]] to form [[3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA]] ([[HMG-CoA]]).<ref name="Mehta">{{cite web|url=http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2013/09/biosynthesis-and-regulation-of-cholesterol-animation/|title=Biosynthesis and Regulation of Cholesterol (with Animation)|work=PharmaXChange.info}}</ref> 
[[File:Condensation of Acetyl-CoA to HMG-CoA.gif|center|frameless|500px]]

This molecule is then reduced to [[mevalonate]] by the enzyme [[HMG-CoA reductase]]. Production of [[mevalonate]] is the rate-limiting and irreversible step in cholesterol synthesis and is the site of action for [[statin]]s (a class of cholesterol lowering drugs).

[[File:Melavonic Acid Synthesis.gif|center|frameless|500px]]
Mevalonate is finally converted to [[isopentenyl pyrophosphate]] (IPP) through two phosphorylation steps and one decarboxylation step that requires [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].

[[Konrad Bloch]] and [[Feodor Lynen]] shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1964 for their discoveries concerning some of the mechanisms and methods of regulation of cholesterol and [[fatty acid metabolism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1964/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine,  1964|last=|first=|date=|publisher==Nobel Prize, Nobel Media |archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>

===Regulation of cholesterol synthesis===
Biosynthesis of cholesterol is directly regulated by the cholesterol levels present, though the [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] mechanisms involved are only partly understood. A higher intake from food leads to a net decrease in endogenous production, whereas lower intake from food has the opposite effect. The main regulatory mechanism is the sensing of [[intracellular]] cholesterol in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] by the [[protein]] [[sterol regulatory element binding protein|SREBP]] (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and 2).<ref name="Espenshade_2007">{{cite journal | vauthors = Espenshade PJ, Hughes AL | title = Regulation of sterol synthesis in eukaryotes | journal = Annu. Rev. Genet. | volume = 41 | issue =  | pages = 401–27 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17666007 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.41.110306.130315 }}</ref> In the presence of cholesterol, SREBP is bound to two other proteins: [[SREBP cleavage-activating protein|SCAP]] (SREBP cleavage-activating protein) and [[INSIG-1]]. When cholesterol levels fall, INSIG-1 dissociates from the SREBP-SCAP complex, which allows the complex to migrate to the [[Golgi apparatus]]. Here SREBP is cleaved by S1P and S2P (site-1 protease and site-2 protease), two enzymes that are activated by SCAP when cholesterol levels are low.

The cleaved SREBP then migrates to the nucleus, and acts as a [[transcription factor]] to bind to the sterol regulatory element (SRE), which stimulates the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of many genes. Among these are the low-density lipoprotein ([[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]]) receptor and [[HMG-CoA reductase]]. The LDL receptor scavenges circulating LDL from the bloodstream, whereas HMG-CoA reductase leads to an increase of endogenous production of cholesterol.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown MS, Goldstein JL | title = The SREBP pathway: regulation of cholesterol metabolism by proteolysis of a membrane-bound transcription factor | journal = Cell | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 331–40 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9150132 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80213-5 }}</ref> A large part of this signaling pathway was clarified by Dr. [[Michael S. Brown]] and Dr. [[Joseph L. Goldstein]] in the 1970s. In 1985, they received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for their work. Their subsequent work shows how the SREBP pathway regulates expression of many genes that control lipid formation and metabolism and body fuel allocation.

Cholesterol synthesis can also be turned off when cholesterol levels are high. HMG-CoA reductase contains both a cytosolic domain (responsible for its catalytic function) and a membrane domain. The membrane domain senses signals for its degradation. Increasing concentrations of cholesterol (and other sterols) cause a change in this domain's oligomerization state, which makes it more susceptible to destruction by the [[proteosome]]. This enzyme's activity can also be reduced by phosphorylation by an AMP-activated protein [[kinase]]. Because this kinase is activated by AMP, which is produced when ATP is hydrolyzed, it follows that cholesterol synthesis is halted when ATP levels are low.<ref name="isbn0-7167-4955-6">{{cite book | last1 = Tymoczko | first1 = John L. | last2 = Berg | first2 = Tymoczko | last3 = Stryer | first3 = Lubert | last4 = Berg | first4 = Jeremy Mark | name-list-format = vanc | title = Biochemistry | edition = | publisher = W.H.

===Plasma transport and regulation of absorption===
{{See also|Blood lipids}}

[[File:MetabolismoLipidiE.png|thumb|Lipid logistics: transport of triglycerides and cholesterol in organisms in form of lipoproteins as chylomicrons, VLDL, LDL, IDL, HDL.]]
As an isolated molecule, cholesterol is only minimally soluble in [[water]]; it dissolves into the (water-based) bloodstream only at exceedingly small concentrations. Instead, cholesterol is transported within [[lipoprotein]]s, complex discoidal particles with exterior [[amphiphile|amphiphilic]] proteins and lipids, whose outward-facing surfaces are water-soluble and inward-facing surfaces are lipid-soluble; i.e. transport via [[emulsification]]. [[Triglyceride]]s and cholesterol esters are carried internally. Phospholipids and cholesterol, being amphipathic, are transported in the monolayer surface of the lipoprotein particle.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

There are several types of lipoproteins in the blood. In order of increasing density, they are [[chylomicron]]s, [[very-low-density lipoprotein]] (VLDL), [[intermediate-density lipoprotein]] (IDL), [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL), and [[high-density lipoprotein]] (HDL). Lower protein/lipid ratios make for less dense lipoproteins. Cholesterol within different lipoproteins is identical, although some is carried as its native "free" alcohol form (the cholesterol-OH group facing the water surrounding the particles), while others as fatty acyl esters, known also as cholesterol esters, within the particles.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Lipoprotein particles are organized by complex [[apolipoproteins]], typically 80–100 different proteins per particle, which can be recognized and bound by specific receptors on cell membranes, directing their lipid payload into specific cells and tissues currently ingesting these fat transport particles. Lipoprotein particles thus include a molecular addresses which play key roles in distribution and delivery of fats around the body in the water outside cells.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Chylomicrons, the least dense cholesterol transport molecules, contain [[apolipoprotein B-48]], [[apolipoprotein C]], and [[apolipoprotein E]] (the principal cholesterol carrier in the brain<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=27277824|year=2016|author1=Mahley|first1=R. W.|title=Apolipoprotein E: From cardiovascular disease to neurodegenerative disorders|journal=Journal of Molecular Medicine|volume=94|issue=7|pages=739–46|doi=10.1007/s00109-016-1427-y|pmc=4921111}}</ref>) in their shells. Chylomicrons carry fats from the intestine to muscle and other tissues in need of fatty acids for energy or fat production. Unused cholesterol remains in more cholesterol-rich chylomicron remnants, and taken up from here to the bloodstream by the liver.

VLDL molecules are produced by the liver from triacylglycerol and cholesterol which was not used in the synthesis of bile acids. These molecules contain [[apolipoprotein B100]] and [[apolipoprotein E]] in their shells, and are degraded by [[lipoprotein lipase]] on the blood vessel wall to IDL.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Blood vessels cleave and absorb triacylglycerol from IDL molecules, increasing the concentration of cholesterol. IDL molecules are then consumed in two processes: half is metabolized by [[HTGL]] and taken up by the LDL receptor on the liver cell surfaces, while the other half continues to lose triacylglycerols in the bloodstream until they become LDL molecules, with the highest concentration of cholesterol within them.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

LDL particles are the major blood cholesterol carriers. Each one contains approximately 1,500 molecules of cholesterol ester. LDL molecule shells contain just one molecule of [[apolipoprotein B100]], recognized by [[LDL receptor]]s in peripheral tissues. Upon binding of [[apolipoprotein B100]], many LDL receptors concentrate in [[clathrin]]-coated pits. Both LDL and its receptor form vesicles within a cell via [[endocytosis]]. These vesicles then fuse with a [[lysosome]], where the [[Lysosomal lipase|lysosomal acid lipase]] enzyme hydrolyzes the cholesterol esters. The cholesterol can then be used for membrane biosynthesis or esterified and stored within the cell, so as to not interfere with the cell membranes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

LDL receptors are used up during cholesterol absorption, and its synthesis is regulated by [[SREBP]], the same protein that controls the synthesis of cholesterol ''de novo'', according to its presence inside the cell. A cell with abundant cholesterol will have its LDL receptor synthesis blocked, to prevent new cholesterol in LDL molecules from being taken up. Conversely, LDL receptor synthesis proceeds when a cell is deficient in cholesterol.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

When this process becomes unregulated, LDL molecules without receptors begin to appear in the blood. These LDL molecules are oxidized and taken up by [[macrophages]], which become engorged and form foam cells. These foam cells often become trapped in the walls of blood vessels and contribute to [[atheroma|atherosclerotic plaque]] formation. Differences in cholesterol homeostasis affect the development of early atherosclerosis (carotid intima-media thickness).<ref name="Weingärtner_2010">{{cite journal | vauthors = Weingärtner O, Pinsdorf T, Rogacev KS, Blömer L, Grenner Y, Gräber S, Ulrich C, Girndt M, Böhm M, Fliser D, Laufs U, Lütjohann D, Heine GH | title = The relationships of markers of cholesterol homeostasis with carotid intima-media thickness | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | pages = e13467 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20976107 | pmc = 2956704 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0013467 | editor1-last = Federici | editor1-first = Massimo |bibcode = 2010PLoSO...513467W }}</ref> These plaques are the main causes of heart attacks, strokes, and other serious medical problems, leading to the association of so-called LDL cholesterol (actually a [[lipoprotein]]) with "bad" cholesterol.<ref name="isbn0-7167-4955-6"/>

Cholesterol is susceptible to oxidation and easily forms oxygenated derivatives known as [[oxysterol]]s.

===Hypercholesterolemia===
{{Main article|hypercholesterolemia|lipid hypothesis}}
[[File:ColesterolemiaMortalitaE.png|thumb|Cholesterolemia and mortality for men and women <50 years and >60 years]]
According to the [[lipid hypothesis]], since cholesterol (like all fat molecules) is transported around the body (in the [[Extracellular fluid|water outside cells]]) inside [[lipoprotein]] particles, elevated cholesterol concentrations ([[hypercholesterolemia]]) potentially offer a lower cost way to estimate concentrations of [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]] particles; possibly even low concentrations of functional [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL]] particles, both variations strongly associated with [[cardiovascular disease]] because LDL particles promote [[atheroma]] development in arteries ([[atherosclerosis]]).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

This atherosclerotic disease process, over decades, leads to [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack), [[stroke]], and [[peripheral vascular disease]]. Since higher blood LDL, especially higher LDL particle concentrations and smaller LDL particle size, contribute to this process more than the cholesterol content of the HDL particles,<ref name="Brunzell_2008">{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunzell JD, Davidson M, Furberg CD, Goldberg RB, Howard BV, Stein JH, Witztum JL | title = Lipoprotein management in patients with cardiometabolic risk: consensus statement from the American Diabetes Association and the American College of Cardiology Foundation | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 811–22 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18375431 | doi = 10.2337/dc08-9018 }}</ref> LDL particles are often termed "bad cholesterol" because they have been linked to atheroma formation. On the other hand, high concentrations of functional HDL, which can remove cholesterol from cells and atheroma, offer protection and are sometimes referred to as "good cholesterol". These balances are mostly genetically determined, but can be changed by body build, [[medication]]s, food choices,<ref>[http://heartuk.org.uk/cholesterol-and-diet/mediterranean-diet Department of Health (UK), NHS Choices, "''More evidence for Mediterranean diet''". 8 March 2011.] Access date: Nov 11, 2015</ref> and other factors.<ref name="Durrington_2007">{{cite journal | vauthors = Durrington P | title = Dyslipidaemia | journal = Lancet | volume = 362 | issue = 9385 | pages = 717–31 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12957096 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14234-1 }}</ref>

Conditions with elevated concentrations of oxidized LDL particles, especially "small dense LDL" (sdLDL) particles, are associated with [[atheroma]] formation in the walls of [[artery|arteries]], a condition known as [[atherosclerosis]], which is the principal cause of [[coronary heart disease]] and other forms of [[cardiovascular disease]]. In contrast, HDL particles (especially large HDL) have been identified as a mechanism by which cholesterol and inflammatory mediators can be removed from atheroma. Increased concentrations of HDL correlate with lower rates of atheroma progressions and even regression. A 2007 study pooling data on almost 900,000 subjects in 61 cohorts demonstrated that blood total cholesterol levels have an exponential effect on cardiovascular and total mortality, with the association more pronounced in younger subjects. Still, because cardiovascular disease is relatively rare in the younger population, the impact of high cholesterol on health is still larger in older people.<ref name="Lewington_2007">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lewington S, Whitlock G, Clarke R, Sherliker P, Emberson J, Halsey J, Qizilbash N, Peto R, Collins R | title = Blood cholesterol and vascular mortality by age, sex, and blood pressure: a meta-analysis of individual data from 61 prospective studies with 55,000 vascular deaths | journal = Lancet | volume = 370 | issue = 9602 | pages = 1829–39 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18061058 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61778-4 }}</ref>

However, as today's testing methods determine LDL ("bad") and HDL ("good") cholesterol separately, this simplistic view has become somewhat outdated. The desirable LDL level is considered to be less than 130&nbsp;mg/dL (2.6 [[Mole (unit)|mmol]]/L),<ref name=AHA>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011020231058/http://www.americanheart.org/cholesterol/about_diff.html |archive-date=20 October 2001 |url=http://www.americanheart.org/cholesterol/about.jsp |dead-url=yes |title=About cholesterol |publisher=American Heart Association |df=dmy }}</ref> although a newer upper limit of 70&nbsp;mg/dL (1.8&nbsp;mmol/L) can be considered in higher-risk individuals based on some of the above-mentioned trials. A ratio of total cholesterol to HDL—another useful measure—of far less than 5:1 is thought to be healthier.

Total cholesterol is defined as the sum of HDL, LDL, and VLDL. Usually, only the total, HDL, and triglycerides are measured. For cost reasons, the VLDL is usually estimated as one-fifth of the triglycerides and the LDL is estimated using the Friedewald formula (or a [[LDL#Measurement of LDL|variant]]): estimated LDL = [total cholesterol] − [total HDL] − [estimated VLDL]. VLDL can be calculated by dividing total triglycerides by five. Direct LDL measures are used when triglycerides exceed 400&nbsp;mg/dL. The estimated VLDL and LDL have more error when triglycerides are above 400&nbsp;mg/dL.<ref name="Warnick_1990">{{cite journal | vauthors = Warnick GR, Knopp RH, Fitzpatrick V, Branson L | title = Estimating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by the Friedewald equation is adequate for classifying patients on the basis of nationally recommended cutpoints | journal = Clin.

Given the well-recognized role of cholesterol in cardiovascular disease, some studies have shown an inverse correlation between cholesterol levels and mortality. A 2009 study of patients with acute coronary syndromes found an association of hypercholesterolemia with better mortality outcomes.<ref name="Wang_2009">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang TY, Newby LK, Chen AY, Mulgund J, Roe MT, Sonel AF, Bhatt DL, [[Elizabeth DeLong|DeLong ER]], Ohman EM, Gibler WB, Peterson ED | title = Hypercholesterolemia paradox in relation to mortality in acute coronary syndrome | journal = Clin Cardiol | volume = 32 | issue = 9 | pages = E22–8 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19645040 | doi = 10.1002/clc.20518 }}</ref> In the [[Framingham Heart Study]], in subjects over 50 years of age, they found an 11% increase overall and 14% increase in cardiovascular disease mortality per 1&nbsp;mg/dL per year drop in total cholesterol levels.

===Hypocholesterolemia===
Abnormally low levels of cholesterol are termed ''[[hypocholesterolemia]]''. Research into the causes of this state is relatively limited, but some studies suggest a link with [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[cancer]], and [[cerebral hemorrhage]]. In general, the low cholesterol levels seem to be a consequence, rather than a cause, of an underlying illness.<ref name="Lewington_2007" /> A genetic defect in cholesterol synthesis causes [[Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome]], which is often associated with low plasma cholesterol levels. [[Hyperthyroidism]], or any other endocrine disturbance which causes upregulation of the [[LDL receptor]], may result in hypocholesterolemia.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rizos CV, Elisaf MS, Liberopoulos EN | title = Effects of thyroid dysfunction on lipid profile | journal = The Open Cardiovascular Medicine Journal | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 76––84 | date = 24 February 2011 | pmid = 21660244 | doi = 10.2174/1874192401105010076 | pmc=3109527}}</ref>

A blood sample after 12-hour fasting is taken by a doctor, or a home cholesterol-monitoring device is used to determine a [[lipid profile|lipoprotein profile]]. This measures total cholesterol, LDL (bad) cholesterol, HDL (good) cholesterol, and triglycerides. It is recommended to test cholesterol at least every five years if a person has total cholesterol of 5.2&nbsp;mmol/L or more (200+&nbsp;mg/dL), or if a man over age 45 or a woman over age 50 has HDL (good) cholesterol less than 1&nbsp;mmol/L (40&nbsp;mg/dL), or there are other risk factors for heart disease and stroke. Other risk factors for heart disease include Diabetes, Hypertension (or use of anti-hypertensive medications), low HDL, family history of CAD and hypercholesterolemia, and cigarette smoking.<ref name="urlATP III Update 2004">{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/cholesterol/atp3upd04.htm |title=Implications of Recent Clinical Trials for the ATP III Guidelines |work= |publisher=National Heart, Lungs and Blood Institute |pages= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202053506/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/cholesterol/atp3upd04.htm |archivedate=2 February 2014 |quote= |accessdate=2014-01-27 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref>

==Cholesteric liquid crystals==
Some cholesterol derivatives (among other simple cholesteric lipids) are known to generate the [[liquid crystal]]line "cholesteric phase". The cholesteric phase is, in fact, a [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] [[Liquid crystal|nematic phase]], and it changes colour when its temperature changes. This makes cholesterol derivatives useful for indicating temperature in [[liquid-crystal display]] [[thermometer]]s and in temperature-sensitive paints.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Stereoisomers==
Cholesterol has 256 [[stereoisomer]]s that arise from its 8 stereocenters, although only two of the stereoisomers are of biochemical significance (''nat''-cholesterol and ''ent''-cholesterol, for ''natural'' and ''enantiomer'', respectively),<ref name="Westover_2003">{{cite journal | vauthors = Westover EJ, Covey DF, Brockman HL, Brown RE, Pike LJ | title = Cholesterol depletion results in site-specific increases in epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation due to membrane level effects.

==Medical uses==
The primary uses of lovastatin is for the treatment of [[dyslipidemia]] and the prevention of [[cardiovascular disease]].<ref name=AHFS/> It is recommended to be used only after other measures, such as diet, exercise, and weight reduction, have not improved cholesterol levels.<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=Lovastatin|url=https://www.drugs.com/monograph/Lovastatin.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref>

==Side effects==
Lovastatin is usually well tolerated, with the most common side effects being, in approximately descending order of frequency: [[creatine phosphokinase]] elevation, [[flatulence]], abdominal pain, constipation, [[diarrhoea]], [[myalgia|muscle aches or pains]], nausea, [[dyspepsia|indigestion]], weakness, blurred vision, rash, dizziness and muscle cramps.<ref name = MSR>{{cite web|title=Mevacor, Altoprev (lovastatin) dosing, indications, interactions, adverse effects, and more|work=Medscape Reference|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=17 March 2014|url=http://reference.medscape.com/drug/mevacor-altoprev-lovastatin-342458#showall}}</ref> As with all statin drugs, it can rarely cause [[myopathy]], [[hepatotoxicity]] (liver damage), [[dermatomyositis]] or [[rhabdomyolysis]].<ref name = MSR/> This can be life-threatening if not recognised and treated in time, so any unexplained muscle pain or weakness whilst on lovastatin should be promptly mentioned to the prescribing doctor.

===Contraindications===
[[Contraindication]]s, conditions that warrant withholding treatment with lovastatin, include pregnancy, breast feeding, and liver disease. Lovastatin is contraindicated during pregnancy (Pregnancy Category X); it may cause birth defects such as skeletal deformities or learning disabilities. Due to its potential to disrupt infant lipid metabolism, lovastatin should not be taken while breastfeeding.<ref name=LactMed>{{cite web|title=Lovastatin|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/f?./temp/~CSZXZ5:1|work=LactMed|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref> Patients with liver disease should not take lovastatin.<ref name="Rxlist">{{cite web|last=Stöppler|first=Melissa|title=Mevacor Side Effects Center|url=http://www.rxlist.com/mevacor-side-effects-drug-center.htm|publisher=RxList|accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Lovastatin is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate.<!--
  --><ref name="Alberts98">{{cite journal | author = Alberts AW | title = Discovery, biochemistry and biology of lovastatin | journal = The American Journal of Cardiology | volume = 62 | pages = 10J–15J | year = 1998| doi = 10.1016/0002-9149(88)90002-1 | pmid = 3055919 | issue = 15}}</ref>
Mevalonate is a required building block for cholesterol biosynthesis and lovastatin interferes with its production by acting as a reversible competitive inhibitor for HMG-CoA, which binds to the HMG-CoA reductase. Lovastatin is a [[prodrug]], an inactive lactone in its native form, the gamma-lactone closed ring form in which it is administered, is hydrolysed in vivo to the β-hydroxy acid open ring form; which is the active form.

Lovastatin and other statins have been studied for their [[chemopreventive]] and [[chemotherapeutic]] effects. No such effects were seen in the early studies.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Katz MS |title=Therapy insight: Potential of statins for cancer chemoprevention and therapy |journal=Nature Clinical Practice Oncology |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=82–9 |year=2005 |pmid=16264880 |doi=10.1038/ncponc0097 }}</ref> More recent investigations revealed some chemopreventive and therapeutic effects, for certain types of cancer, especially in combination of statins with other anticancer drugs.<ref>Chae YK, Yousaf M, Malecek MK, Carneiro B, Chandra S, Kaplan J, Kalyan A, Sassano A, Platanias LC, Giles F.

In 1982, some small-scale clinical investigations of lovastatin, a polyketide-derived natural product isolated from ''Aspergillus terreus'', in very high-risk patients were undertaken, in which dramatic reductions in LDL cholesterol were observed, with very few adverse effects. After the additional animal safety studies with lovastatin revealed no toxicity of the type thought to be associated with compactin, clinical studies continued.

==Discovery, biochemistry and biology==
[[Image:Lovastatin2.png|180px|thumb|right|A ball-and-stick model of lovastatin]]

An elevated concentration of plasma cholesterol, especially [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL) cholesterol, is now generally accepted as a major risk factor for the development of coronary heart disease.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007115.htm Coronary heart disease: MedLine Plus Medical Encyclopedia]</ref> The objective is to decrease excess levels of cholesterol to an amount consistent with maintenance of normal body function. Cholesterol is biosynthesized in a series of more than 25 separate enzymatic reactions that initially involves three successive condensations of acetyl-CoA units to form the six-carbon compound 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA). This is reduced to mevalonate and then converted in a series of reactions to the [[isoprene]]s that are building-blocks of [[squalene]], the immediate precursor to sterols, which cyclizes to lanosterol (a methylated sterol) and further metabolized to cholesterol. A number of early attempts to block the synthesis of cholesterol resulted in agents that inhibited late in the biosynthetic pathway between lanosterol and cholesterol. A major rate-limiting step in the pathway is at the level of the microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG CoA to mevalonic acid, and that has been considered to be a prime target for pharmacologic intervention for several years.<ref name="Alberts98"/>

HMG CoA reductase occurs early in the biosynthetic pathway and is among the first committed steps to cholesterol formulation. Inhibition of this enzyme could lead to accumulation of HMG CoA, a water-soluble intermediate that is, then, capable of being readily metabolized to simpler molecules. This inhibition of reductase would lead to accumulation of lipophylic intermediates with a formal sterol ring.

Lovastatin was the first specific inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase to receive approval for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The first breakthrough in efforts to find a potent, specific, competitive inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase occurred in 1976, when [[Akira Endo (biochemist)|Endo]] ''et al.'' reported the discovery of [[mevastatin]], a highly functionalized fungal metabolite, isolated from cultures of ''Penicillium citrium''.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Akira|last=Endo|author2=Kuroda M. |author3=Tsujita Y. |title=ML-236A, ML-236B, and ML-236C, new inhibitors of cholesterogenesis produced by Penicillium citrinium|journal=Journal of Antibiotics (Tokyo)|date=December 1976|volume=29|issue=12|pages=1346–8|pmid=1010803|doi=10.7164/antibiotics.29.1346}}</ref>  Mevastatin was demonstrated to be an unusually potent inhibitor of the target enzyme and of cholesterol biosynthesis. Subsequent to the first reports describing mevastatin, efforts were initiated to search for other naturally occurring inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase. This led to the discovery of a novel fungal metabolite – lovastatin. The structure of lovastatin was determined to be different from that of mevastatin by the presence of a six alphamethyl group in the hexahydronaphthalene ring.

Key points from the study of the biosynthesis of lovastatin:

* Lovastatin is composed of two polyketide chains derived from acetate, two and four carbons long, coupled in head-to-tail fashion.
* The six alphamethyl group and the methyl group on the four-carbon side-chain are derived from the methyl group of methionine.
* The six alphamethyl group is added before closure of the rings.

This implies that lovastatin is a unique compound synthesized by ''A. terreus'' and that mevastatin is not an intermediate in its formation.

===Biosynthesis using Diels-Alder catalyzed cyclization===

''In vitro'' formation of a triketide lactone using a genetically modified protein derived from 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase has been demonstrated. Witter and Vederas observed, "the stereochemistry of the molecule supports the intriguing idea that an enzyme-catalyzed [[Diels-Alder]] reaction may occur during assembly of the polyketide chain. It, thus, appears that biological Diels-Alder reactions may be triggered by generation of reactive triene systems on an enzyme surface."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Witter | first =DJ |author2=Vederas, JC  |title=Putative Diels-Alder catalyzed cyclization during the biosynthesis of lovastatin |journal=[[J Org Chem]] |volume=61 |issue=8|pages=2613–23|year=1996 |doi=10.1021/jo952117p |pmid = 11667090}}</ref>

===Total synthesis===

Hirama synthesized compactin and used one of the intermediates to follow a different path to get to lovastatin. The synthetic sequence is shown in the schemes below. The γ-lactone was synthesized using Yamada methodology starting with glutamic acid. Lactone opening was done using lithium methoxide in [[methanol]] and then [[silylation]] to give a separable mixture of the starting lactone and the [[silyl ether]]. The silyl ether on hydrogenolysis followed by Collins oxidation gave the aldehyde. Stereoselective preparation of (E,E)-diene was accomplished by addition of trans-crotyl phenyl sulfone anion, followed by quenching with [[Acetic anhydride|Ac<sub>2</sub>O]] and subsequent reductive elimination of sulfone acetate. Condensation of this with lithium anion of dimethyl methylphosphonate gave compound 1. Compound 2 was synthesized as shown in the scheme in the synthetic procedure. Compounds 1 and 2 were then combined together using 1.3 eq sodium hydride in THF followed by reflux in [[chlorobenzene]] for 82 hr under nitrogen to get the enone 3.

Simple organic reactions were used to get to lovastatin as shown in the scheme.

The primary uses of simvastatin are to treat [[dyslipidemia]] and to prevent atherosclerosis-related complications such as stroke and heart attacks in those who are at high risk.<ref name="AHFS2015"/> It is recommended to be used as an addition to a low cholesterol diet.<ref name="AHFS2015"/>

In the [[Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study]] (a placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of 5 years duration), simvastatin reduced overall mortality in people with existing cardiovascular disease and high LDL cholesterol by 30% and reduced cardiovascular mortality by 42%. The risks of heart attack, stroke, or needing a coronary revascularization procedure were reduced by 37%, 28%, and 37% respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/019766s093lbl.pdf|title=www.accessdata.fda.gov|format=|work=|accessdate=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208172832/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/019766s093lbl.pdf|archivedate=2015-12-08|df=}}</ref>

The [[Heart Protection Study]] evaluated the effects of simvastatin in people with risk factors including existing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or stroke but having relatively low LDL cholesterol.  In this trial, which lasted 5.4 years, overall mortality was reduced by 13% and cardiovascular mortality was reduced by 18%.  People receiving simvastatin experienced 38% fewer non-fatal heart attacks and 25% fewer strokes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/019766s093lbl.pdf|title=www.accessdata.fda.gov|format=|work=|accessdate=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208172832/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/019766s093lbl.pdf|archivedate=2015-12-08|df=}}</ref>

* FDA has found that liver injury associated with statin use is rare but can occur.
* The reports about memory loss, forgetfulness, and confusion span all statin products and all age groups. The FDA says these experiences are rare but that those affected often report feeling “fuzzy” or unfocused in their thinking.
* A small increased risk of raised blood sugar levels and the development of type 2 diabetes have been reported with the use of statins.
* Some drugs interact with statins in a way that increases the risk of muscle injury called myopathy, characterized by unexplained muscle weakness or pain.

==Interactions==
Simvastatin has important interactions with [[grapefruit]] juice and other drugs, including some that are commonly used for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.

==Pharmacology ==
{{Main|Statin}}
All statins act by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) coenzyme A reductase. [[HMG-CoA reductase]], the [[Rate-determining step|rate-limiting]] [[enzyme]] of the [[HMG-CoA reductase pathway]], the [[metabolic pathway]] responsible for the endogenous production of [[cholesterol]]. Statins are more effective than other lipid-regulating drugs at lowering [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]]-cholesterol concentration, but they are less effective than the [[fibrate]]s in reducing triglyceride concentration. However, statins reduce cardiovascular disease events and total mortality irrespective of the initial cholesterol concentration. This is a major piece of evidence that statins work in another way than the lowering of cholesterol (called pleiotropic effects).<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 21391729 | year = 2010 | last1 = Pedersen | first1 = TR | title = Pleiotropic effects of statins: Evidence against benefits beyond LDL-cholesterol lowering | volume = 10 Suppl 1 | pages = 10–7 | doi = 10.2165/1158822-S0-000000000-00000 | journal = American Journal of Cardiovascular Drugs}}</ref>

The drug is in the form of an inactive [[lactone]] that is [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] after ingestion to produce the active agent. It is a white, [[nonhygroscopic]], crystalline powder that is practically insoluble in water, and freely soluble in [[chloroform]], [[methanol]], and [[ethanol]].

Simvastatin is an effective [[lipid]]-lowering drug that can decrease [[low density lipoprotein]] (LDL) levels by up to 50%.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
Recently, simvastatin had been shown to interact with lipid lowering transcription factor PPAR-alpha (Roy etal. Cell Metabolism 2015) and that interaction might control the neurotrophic action of the drug.

==History==
The development of simvastatin was closely linked with [[lovastatin]]. Biochemist Jesse Huff and his colleagues at Merck began researching the biosynthesis of cholesterol in the early 1950s.<ref>{{cite book |author=Jie Jack Li |title=Triumph of the Heart : The Story of Statins |pages=59 |year=2009 | isbn = 0198043511 | publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> In 1956, [[mevalonic acid]] was isolated from a yeast extract by [[Karl Folkers]], Carl Hoffman, and others at Merck, while Huff and his associates confirmed that mevalonic acid was an intermediate in cholesterol biosynthesis. In 1959, the [[HMG-CoA reductase]] enzyme (a major contributor of internal cholesterol production) was discovered by researchers at the [[Max Planck Institute]]. This discovery encouraged scientists worldwide to find an effective inhibitor of this enzyme.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

By 1976, [[Akira Endo (biochemist)|Akira Endo]] had isolated the first inhibitor, [[mevastatin]], from the [[fungus]] ''[[Penicillium|Penicillium citrinium]]'' while working at [[Daiichi Sankyo]] in Japan.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Liao JK, Laufs U |title=Pleiotropic effects of statins |journal=Annu.

In 1994, publication of the results of the [[Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study]] (4S) provided the first unequivocal evidence that lowering LDL cholesterol via statin treatment reduces cardiovascular events and overall mortality.  A total of 4,444 people with coronary heart disease 5.5 to 8.0&nbsp;mmol/L were randomized to simvastatin treatment or placebo and followed for an average of 5 years. Compared to the placebo group, those treated with simvastatin experienced a 30% decrease in overall mortality, a 42% reduction in coronary death, a 34% reduction in major coronary events, and a 37% reduction in revascularization procedures.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tobert JA |title=Lovastatin and beyond: the history of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors |journal=Nat Rev Drug Discov |volume=2 |issue=7 |pages=517–26 |year=2003 |pmid=12815379 |doi=10.1038/nrd1112 |url=}}</ref>

===Economics===
Simvastatin was introduced in the late 1980s, and since 2006 in many countries, it is available as a [[Generic drug|generic]] preparation. This has led to a decrease of the price of most statin drugs, and a reappraisal of the health economics of preventive statin treatment.  In the UK in 2008, the typical per-patient cost to the NHS of simvastatin was about £1.50 per month.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/politics_show/7192271.stm |title=NHS overspends on statins |date=Jan 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214163933/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/politics_show/7192271.stm |archivedate=2009-02-14 |df= }}</ref> (40&nbsp;mg/day costs UK NHS £1.37/month in 2012<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cks.nhs.uk/diabetes_type_2/drugs_in_this_topic/scenario_managing_lipids/simvastatin_40mg_tablets |title=Simvastatin 40mg tablets }}</ref>)

Prior to losing U.S. patent protection, simvastatin was Merck & Co.'s largest-selling drug and second-largest-selling cholesterol lowering drug in the world. In 2005, recorded US$3.1&nbsp;[[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] of sales in the US and US$4.4&nbsp;[[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Berenson|first1=Alex|title=Merck Loses Protection for Patent on Zocor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/23/business/23statin.html?_r=0|accessdate=14 January 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=23 June 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114212534/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/23/business/23statin.html?_r=0|archivedate=14 January 2015|df=}}</ref>

Zocor had an original patent expiry date of January 2006, but was extended by the United States Patent Trademark Office (PTO) to expire on June 23, 2006.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The PTO granted the patent extension after Merck submitted data from studies of the drug’s positive effect on children. In the UK, the patent for simvastatin had expired by 2004.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In the UK, simvastatin is the most prescribed medication in the community, with 39.9 million items dispensed in 2013. This compares to 30.9 million items for [[aspirin]], and 27.7 million for [[levothyroxine sodium]], the second and third most prescribed drugs in the UK in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Twenty most prescribed drugs in the community in England in 2013|url=http://www.qualitywatch.org.uk/indicator/antibiotic-prescribing|website=QualityWatch|publisher=Nuffield Trust & Health Foundation|accessdate=14 January 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114213112/http://www.qualitywatch.org.uk/indicator/antibiotic-prescribing|archivedate=14 January 2015|df=}}</ref>

{{pp-semi-indef}}

{{Infobox oxygen}}
'''Oxygen''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&nbsp;'''O''' and [[atomic number]] 8. It is a member of the [[chalcogen]] [[Group (periodic table)|group]] on the [[periodic table]], a highly [[Chemical reaction|reactive]] [[nonmetal]], and an [[oxidizing agent]] that readily forms [[oxide]]s with most elements as well as with other [[chemical compound|compounds]].  By mass, oxygen is the third-[[Abundance of the chemical elements|most abundant element]] in the universe, after [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]].  At [[standard temperature and pressure]], two atoms of the element [[chemical bond|bind]] to form [[Allotropes of oxygen#Dioxygen|dioxygen]], a colorless and odorless [[diatomic molecule|diatomic]] [[gas]] with the formula {{chem|O|2}}. Diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. As compounds including oxides, the element makes up almost half of the [[Earth's crust]].

Dioxygen is used in [[cellular respiration]] and many major classes of [[organic molecule]]s in [[living organism]]s contain oxygen, such as [[protein]]s, [[nucleic acid]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, and [[fat]]s, as do the major constituent [[inorganic compound]]s of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen is continuously replenished in Earth's atmosphere by [[photosynthesis]], which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water and carbon dioxide. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms. Another form ([[allotropes of oxygen|allotrope]]) of oxygen, [[ozone]] ({{chem|O|3}}), strongly absorbs ultraviolet [[UVB]] radiation and the high-altitude [[ozone layer]] helps protect the [[biosphere]] from [[ultraviolet radiation]]. However, ozone present at the surface is a byproduct of [[smog]] and thus a pollutant.

Oxygen was discovered independently by [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]], in [[Uppsala]], in 1773 or earlier, and [[Joseph Priestley]] in [[Wiltshire]], in 1774, but Priestley is often given priority because his work was published first. The name ''oxygen'' was coined in 1777 by [[Antoine Lavoisier]], whose experiments with oxygen helped to discredit the then-popular [[phlogiston theory]] of [[combustion]] and [[corrosion]].  Its name derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] roots ὀξύς ''oxys'', "acid", literally "sharp", referring to the [[Taste#Sourness|sour taste]] of [[acid]]s and -γενής ''-genes'', "producer", literally "begetter", because at the time of naming, it was mistakenly thought that all acids required oxygen in their composition.

Common uses of oxygen include residential [[HVAC|heating]], [[internal combustion engine]]s, production of [[steel]], [[plastics]] and [[textiles]], [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|brazing, welding and cutting]] of steels and other [[metals]], [[rocket propellant]], [[oxygen therapy]], and [[life support system]]s in [[aircraft]], [[submarines]], [[human spaceflight|spaceflight]] and [[underwater diving|diving]].

==History==
===Early experiments===

One of the first known experiments on the relationship between [[combustion]] and air was conducted by the 2nd century&nbsp;BCE [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] writer on mechanics, [[Philo of Byzantium]]. In his work ''Pneumatica'', Philo observed that inverting a vessel over a burning candle and surrounding the vessel's neck with water resulted in some water rising into the neck.<ref>{{cite book|title = Story of Human Error|first = Joseph |last = Jastrow|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tRUO45YfCHwC&pg=PA171&lpg=PA171|page= 171 |date = 1936|publisher = Ayer Publishing|isbn = 0-8369-0568-7}}</ref> Philo incorrectly surmised that parts of the air in the vessel were converted into the [[classical element]] [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] and thus were able to escape through pores in the glass. Many centuries later [[Leonardo da Vinci]] built on Philo's work by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion and [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]].<ref name="ECE499">[[#Reference-idCook1968|Cook & Lauer 1968]], p.499.</ref>

In the late 17th&nbsp;century, [[Robert Boyle]] proved that air is necessary for combustion. English chemist [[John Mayow]] (1641–1679) refined this work by showing that fire requires only a part of air that he called ''spiritus nitroaereus''.<ref name="EB1911">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Mayow, John|volume=17|pages=938–939}}</ref> In one experiment, he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise and replace one-fourteenth of the air's volume before extinguishing the subjects.<ref name="WoC">{{cite book|title=World of Chemistry|chapter=John Mayow|date=2005|publisher=Thomson Gale|url=http://www.bookrags.com/John_Mayow|accessdate=December 16, 2007|author=''World of Chemistry'' contributors|isbn=0-669-32727-1}}</ref> From this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion.

Mayow observed that [[antimony]] increased in weight when heated, and inferred that the nitroaereus must have combined with it.<ref name="EB1911"/> He also thought that the lungs separate nitroaereus from air and pass it into the blood and that animal heat and muscle movement result from the reaction of nitroaereus with certain substances in the body.<ref name="EB1911"/> Accounts of these and other experiments and ideas were published in 1668 in his work ''Tractatus duo'' in the tract "De respiratione".<ref name="WoC"/>

===Phlogiston theory===
{{Main article|Phlogiston theory}}

[[Robert Hooke]], [[Ole Borch]], [[Mikhail Lomonosov]], and [[Pierre Bayen]] all produced oxygen in experiments in the 17th and the 18th century but none of them recognized it as a [[chemical element]].<ref name="NBB299">[[#Reference-idEmsley2001|Emsley 2001]], p.299</ref> This may have been in part due to the prevalence of the philosophy of combustion and [[corrosion]] called the ''phlogiston theory'', which was then the favored explanation of those processes.<ref>Nicholas W. Best, "[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10698-015-9220-5 Lavoisier's 'Reflections on Phlogiston' I: Against Phlogiston Theory"], ''[[Foundations of Chemistry]]'', 2015, '''17''', 137-151.</ref>

Established in 1667 by the German alchemist [[J. J. Becher]], and modified by the chemist [[Georg Ernst Stahl]] by 1731,<ref name="morris">{{cite book| title = The last sorcerers: The path from alchemy to the periodic table

One part, called phlogiston, was given off when the substance containing it was burned, while the dephlogisticated part was thought to be its true form, or [[calx]].<ref name="ECE499"/>

Highly combustible materials that leave little [[residue (chemistry)|residue]], such as wood or coal, were thought to be made mostly of phlogiston; non-combustible substances that corrode, such as iron, contained very little. Air did not play a role in phlogiston theory, nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea; instead, it was based on observations of what happens when something burns, that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process.<ref name="ECE499"/>

===Discovery===
[[File:PriestleyFuseli.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Joseph Priestley]] is usually given priority in the discovery.|alt=A drawing of an elderly man sitting by the table and facing parallel to the drawing. His left arm rests on a notebook, legs crossed]]
Oxygen was first discovered by Swedish pharmacist [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]]. He had produced oxygen gas by heating mercuric oxide and various [[nitrate]]s in 1771–2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/8/oxygen |title=Oxygen  |publisher=RSC.org |accessdate=2016-12-12}}</ref><ref name="ECE500"/><ref name="ECE499"/> Scheele called the gas "fire air" because it was the only known supporter of combustion, and wrote an account of this discovery in a manuscript he titled ''Treatise on Air and Fire'', which he sent to his publisher in 1775. That document was published in 1777.<ref name="NBB300">[[#Reference-idEmsley2001|Emsley 2001]], p.300</ref>

In the meantime, on August 1, 1774, an experiment conducted by the British clergyman [[Joseph Priestley]] focused sunlight on [[mercury(II) oxide|mercuric oxide]] (HgO) inside a glass tube, which liberated a gas he named "dephlogisticated air".<ref name="ECE500">[[#Reference-idCook1968|Cook & Lauer 1968]], p.500</ref> He noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing it. After breathing the gas himself, he wrote: "The feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air, but I fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards."<ref name="NBB299"/> Priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled "An Account of Further Discoveries in Air" which was included in the second volume of his book titled ''[[Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air]]''.<ref name="ECE499"/><ref>{{cite journal|title = An Account of Further Discoveries in Air|first = Joseph|last = Priestley|journal = Philosophical Transactions|date = 1775|volume = 65|pages = 384–94|doi = 10.1098/rstl.1775.0039}}</ref> Because he published his findings first, Priestley is usually given priority in the discovery.

The French chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier|Antoine Laurent Lavoisier]] later claimed to have discovered the new substance independently. Priestley visited Lavoisier in October 1774 and told him about his experiment and how he liberated the new gas. Scheele also posted a letter to Lavoisier on September 30, 1774 that described his discovery of the previously unknown substance, but Lavoisier never acknowledged receiving it (a copy of the letter was found in Scheele's belongings after his death).<ref name="NBB300"/>
{{clear}}

===Lavoisier's contribution===
Lavoisier conducted the first adequate quantitative experiments on [[oxidation]] and gave the first correct explanation of how combustion works.<ref name="ECE500"/> He used these and similar experiments, all started in 1774, to discredit the phlogiston theory and to prove that the substance discovered by Priestley and Scheele was a [[chemical element]].
[[File:Antoine lavoisier.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Antoine Lavoisier]] discredited the phlogiston theory.|alt=A drawing of a young man facing towards the viewer, but looking on the side. He wear a white curly wig, dark suit and white scarf.]]
In one experiment, Lavoisier observed that there was no overall increase in weight when [[tin]] and air were heated in a closed container.<ref name="ECE500"/> He noted that air rushed in when he opened the container, which indicated that part of the trapped air had been consumed. He also noted that the tin had increased in weight and that increase was the same as the weight of the air that rushed back in. This and other experiments on combustion were documented in his book ''Sur la combustion en général'', which was published in 1777.<ref name="ECE500"/> In that work, he proved that air is a mixture of two gases; 'vital air', which is essential to combustion and respiration, and ''azote'' (Gk. ''{{lang|grc|ἄζωτον}}'' "lifeless"), which did not support either. ''Azote'' later became ''[[nitrogen]]'' in English, although it has kept the earlier name in French and several other European languages.<ref name="ECE500"/>

Lavoisier renamed 'vital air' to ''oxygène'' in 1777 from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] roots ''{{lang|grc|ὀξύς}} (oxys)'' ([[acid]], literally "sharp", from the taste of acids) and ''-γενής (-genēs)'' (producer, literally begetter), because he mistakenly believed that oxygen was a constituent of all acids.<ref name="mellor">{{cite book|last=Parks|first=G. D.|last2=Mellor|first2=J. W.|date=1939|title=Mellor's Modern Inorganic Chemistry|edition=6th |publisher=Longmans, Green and Co.|location=London}}</ref> Chemists (such as Sir [[Humphry Davy]] in 1812) eventually determined that Lavoisier was wrong in this regard (hydrogen forms the basis for acid chemistry), but by then the name was too well established.<ref>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd|page=793}}</ref>

''Oxygen'' entered the English language despite opposition by English scientists and the fact that the Englishman Priestley had first isolated the gas and written about it. This is partly due to a poem praising the gas titled "Oxygen" in the popular book ''[[The Botanic Garden]]'' (1791) by [[Erasmus Darwin]], grandfather of [[Charles Darwin]].<ref name="NBB300"/>

===Later history===

[[John Dalton]]'s original [[Atomic theory#Earliest empirical evidence|atomic hypothesis]] presumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another. For example, Dalton assumed that water's formula was HO, giving the [[atomic mass]] of oxygen was 8 times that of hydrogen, instead of the modern value of about 16.<ref>{{cite book| title = The Interactive Textbook of PFP96 |chapter= Do We Take Atoms for Granted?|chapterurl=http://www.physics.upenn.edu/courses/gladney/mathphys/subsubsection1_1_3_2.html |url=http://www.physics.upenn.edu/courses/gladney/mathphys/Contents.html |first=Dennis |last=DeTurck |last2=Gladney|first2=Larry|last3=Pietrovito|first3=Anthony| publisher=University of Pennsylvania|date=1997|accessdate=January 28, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080117230939/http://www.physics.upenn.edu/courses/gladney/mathphys/subsubsection1_1_3_2.html |archivedate = January 17, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> In 1805, [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] and [[Alexander von Humboldt]] showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen; and by 1811 [[Amedeo Avogadro]] had arrived at the correct interpretation of water's composition, based on what is now called [[Avogadro's law]] and the diatomic elemental molecules in those gases.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Treatise on Chemistry|first=Henry Enfield |last=Roscoe |last2=Schorlemmer|first2=Carl|page=38|date=1883|publisher=D. Appleton and Co.}}</ref><ref group=lower-alpha>These results were mostly ignored until 1860. Part of this rejection was due to the belief that atoms of one element would have no [[chemical affinity]] towards atoms of the same element, and part was due to apparent exceptions to Avogadro's law that were not explained until later in terms of dissociating molecules.</ref>

By the late 19th century scientists realized that air could be liquefied and its components isolated by compressing and cooling it. Using a [[Cascade (chemical engineering)|cascade]] method, Swiss chemist and physicist [[Raoul Pictet|Raoul Pierre Pictet]] [[evaporation|evaporated]] liquid [[sulfur dioxide]] in order to liquefy carbon dioxide, which in turn was evaporated to cool oxygen gas enough to liquefy it. He sent a telegram on December 22, 1877 to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in Paris announcing his discovery of [[liquid oxygen]].<ref name="BES707">{{cite book|title=Biographical Encyclopedia of Scientists|last=Daintith|first=John|date=1994|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-7503-0287-9|page=707}}</ref> Just two days later, French physicist [[Louis Paul Cailletet]] announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen.<ref name="BES707"/> Only a few drops of the liquid were produced in each case and no meaningful analysis could be conducted. Oxygen was liquified in a stable state for the first time on March 29, 1883 by Polish scientists from [[Jagiellonian University]], [[Zygmunt Wróblewski]] and [[Karol Olszewski]].<ref>{{cite journal|title = Louis Paul Cailletet: The liquefaction of oxygen and the emergence of low-temperature research  |first =Faidra |last = Papanelopoulou |journal =Notes and Records, Royal Society of London |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3826198/|date = 2013|volume = 67 |issue=4|pages = 355–73|doi = 10.1098/rsnr.2013.0047}}</ref>

In 1891 Scottish chemist [[James Dewar]] was able to produce enough liquid oxygen for study.<ref name="NBB303">[[#Reference-idEmsley2001|Emsley 2001]], p.303</ref> The first commercially viable process for producing liquid oxygen was independently developed in 1895 by German engineer [[Carl von Linde]] and British engineer William Hampson. Both men lowered the temperature of air until it liquefied and then [[distillation|distilled]] the component gases by boiling them off one at a time and capturing them separately.<ref name="HPAM">{{cite book|title=How Products are Made|chapter=Oxygen|publisher=The Gale Group, Inc.|date=2002|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/oxygen|accessdate=December 16, 2007|author=''How Products are Made'' contributors}}</ref> Later, in 1901, oxyacetylene [[welding]] was demonstrated for the first time by burning a mixture of [[acetylene]] and compressed {{chem|O|2}}. This method of welding and cutting metal later became common.<ref name="HPAM"/>

In 1923, the American scientist [[Robert H. Goddard]] became the first person to develop a [[rocket engine]] that burned liquid fuel; the engine used [[gasoline]] for fuel and liquid oxygen as the [[oxidizer]]. Goddard successfully flew a small liquid-fueled rocket 56&nbsp;m at 97&nbsp;km/h on March 16, 1926 in [[Auburn, Massachusetts]], US.<ref name="HPAM"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Goddard-1926 |url=http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2002-000132.html |publisher=NASA |accessdate=November 18, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108225824/http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2002-000132.html |archivedate=November 8, 2007 |df= }}</ref>

[[File:Oxygen molecule orbitals diagram.JPG|thumb|left|260 px|Orbital diagram, after Barrett (2002),<ref name=Barrett2002/> showing the participating atomic orbitals from each oxygen atom, the molecular orbitals that result from their overlap, and the [[Aufbau principle|aufbau]] filling of the orbitals with the 12 electrons, 6 from each O atom, beginning from the lowest energy orbitals, and resulting in covalent double bond character from filled orbitals (and cancellation of the contributions of the pairs of σ and σ<sup>*</sup> and {{pi}} and {{pi}}<sup>*</sup> orbital pairs).]]
At [[standard temperature and pressure]], oxygen is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas with the [[molecular formula]] {{chem|O|2}}, referred to as dioxygen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencekids.co.nz/sciencefacts/chemistry/oxygen.html|title=Oxygen Facts|publisher=Science Kids|date=February 6, 2015|accessdate=November 14, 2015}}</ref>

As ''dioxygen'', two oxygen atoms are [[chemical bond|chemically bound]] to each other. The bond can be variously described based on level of theory, but is reasonably and simply described as a covalent [[double bond]] that results from the filling of [[molecular orbitals]] formed from the [[atomic orbital]]s of the individual oxygen atoms, the filling of which results in a [[bond order]] of two. More specifically, the double bond is the result of sequential, low-to-high energy, or [[Aufbau principle|Aufbau]], filling of orbitals, and the resulting cancellation of contributions from the 2s electrons, after sequential filling of the low σ and σ<sup>*</sup> orbitals; σ overlap of the two atomic 2p orbitals that lie along the O-O molecular axis and {{pi}} overlap of two pairs of atomic 2p orbitals perpendicular to the O-O molecular axis, and then cancellation of contributions from the remaining two of the six 2p electrons after their partial filling of the lowest {{pi}} and {{pi}}<sup>*</sup> orbitals.<ref name=Barrett2002>Jack Barrett, 2002, "Atomic Structure and Periodicity, (Basic concepts in chemistry, Vol. 9 of Tutorial chemistry texts), Cambridge, U.K.:Royal Society of Chemistry, p. 153, {{ISBN|0854046577}}, see [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0854046577] accessed January 31, 2015.</ref>

This combination of cancellations and σ and {{pi}} overlaps results in dioxygen's double bond character and reactivity, and a triplet electronic [[ground state]]. An [[electron configuration]] with two unpaired electrons, as is found in dioxygen orbitals (see the filled {{pi}}* orbitals in the diagram) that are of equal energy—i.e., [[degenerate orbitals|degenerate]]—is a configuration termed a [[spin triplet]] state. Hence, the ground state of the {{chem|O|2}} molecule is referred to as [[triplet oxygen]].<ref name="BiochemOnline">{{cite web|work=Biochemistry Online|url=http://employees.csbsju.edu/hjakubowski/classes/ch331/oxphos/oldioxygenchem.html |title=Chapter 8: Oxidation-Phosphorylation, the Chemistry of Di-Oxygen|first=Henry|last=Jakubowski|accessdate=January 28, 2008|publisher=Saint John's University}}</ref><ref group=lower-alpha>An orbital is a concept from [[quantum mechanics]] that models an electron as a [[Wave–particle duality|wave-like particle]] that has a spatial distribution about an atom or molecule.</ref> The highest energy, partially filled orbitals are [[antibonding]], and so their filling weakens the bond order from three to two. Because of its unpaired electrons, triplet oxygen reacts only slowly with most organic molecules, which have paired electron spins; this prevents spontaneous combustion.<ref name="Weiss2008">{{cite journal | last1 = Weiss | first1 = H.

Oxygen [[Solubility|dissolves]] more readily in water than nitrogen, and in freshwater more readily than seawater. Water in equilibrium with air contains approximately 1 molecule of dissolved {{chem|O|2}} for every 2 molecules of {{chem|N|2}} (1:2), compared with an atmospheric ratio of approximately 1:4. The solubility of oxygen in water is temperature-dependent, and about twice as much (14.6&nbsp;mg·L<sup>−1</sup>) dissolves at 0&nbsp;°C than at 20&nbsp;°C (7.6&nbsp;mg·L<sup>−1</sup>).<ref name="NBB299"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/air-solubility-water-d_639.html|title=Air solubility in water|accessdate=December 21, 2007|publisher=The Engineering Toolbox}}</ref> At 25&nbsp;°C and {{convert|1|atm|lk=on|sigfig=4}} of air, freshwater contains about 6.04&nbsp;[[Litre|milliliters]]&nbsp;(mL) of oxygen per [[liter]], and [[seawater]] contains about 4.95&nbsp;mL per liter.<ref>{{cite book|title = The Physiology of Fishes |first=David Hudson |last=Evans |last2=Claiborne|first2=James B.|page=88|date=2005|edition=3rd|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-8493-2022-4}}</ref> At 5&nbsp;°C the solubility increases to 9.0&nbsp;mL (50% more than at 25&nbsp;°C) per liter for water and 7.2&nbsp;mL (45% more) per liter for sea water.

The {{chem|O|2}} surrounding those planets is produced solely by the action of ultraviolet radiation on oxygen-containing molecules such as carbon dioxide.

The unusually high concentration of oxygen gas on Earth is the result of the [[oxygen cycle]]. This [[biogeochemical cycle]] describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on Earth: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the [[lithosphere]]. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is [[photosynthesis]], which is responsible for modern Earth's atmosphere. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere, while [[Cellular respiration|respiration]], [[Decomposition|decay]], and combustion remove it from the atmosphere. In the present equilibrium, production and consumption occur at the same rate.<ref>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd|page=602}}</ref>

Free oxygen also occurs in solution in the world's water bodies. The increased solubility of {{chem|O|2}} at lower temperatures (see [[#Physical properties|Physical properties]]) has important implications for ocean life, as polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their higher oxygen content.<ref>From The Chemistry and Fertility of Sea Waters by H.W.

[[Paleoclimatology|Paleoclimatologists]] measure the ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the [[Animal shell|shells]] and [[skeleton]]s of marine organisms to determine the climate millions of years ago (see [[oxygen isotope ratio cycle]]). [[Seawater]] molecules that contain the lighter [[isotope]], oxygen-16, evaporate at a slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the 12% heavier oxygen-18, and this disparity increases at lower temperatures.<ref name="NBB304">[[#Reference-idEmsley2001|Emsley 2001]], p.304</ref> During periods of lower global temperatures, snow and rain from that evaporated water tends to be higher in oxygen-16, and the seawater left behind tends to be higher in oxygen-18. Marine organisms then incorporate more oxygen-18 into their skeletons and shells than they would in a warmer climate.<ref name="NBB304"/> Paleoclimatologists also directly measure this ratio in the water molecules of [[ice core]] samples as old as hundreds of thousands of years.

[[Geology of solar terrestrial planets|Planetary geologists]] have measured the relative quantities of oxygen isotopes in samples from the [[Earth]], the [[Moon]], [[Mars]], and [[meteorite]]s, but were long unable to obtain reference values for the isotope ratios in the [[Sun]], believed to be the same as those of the [[Nebular hypothesis|primordial solar nebula]]. Analysis of a [[silicon]] wafer exposed to the [[solar wind]] in space and returned by the crashed [[Genesis (spacecraft)|Genesis spacecraft]] has shown that the Sun has a higher proportion of oxygen-16 than does the Earth. The measurement implies that an unknown process depleted oxygen-16 from the Sun's [[Protoplanetary disk|disk of protoplanetary material]] prior to the coalescence of dust grains that formed the Earth.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Hand|first = Eric|title = The Solar System's first breath|journal = Nature|volume = 452|page = 259|date = March 13, 2008|url = http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080313/full/452259a.html|doi = 10.1038/452259a|accessdate =March 18, 2009|pmid = 18354437|issue = 7185|bibcode = 2008Natur.452..259H }}</ref>

One hundred&nbsp;million&nbsp;tonnes of {{chem|O|2}} are extracted from air for industrial uses annually by two primary methods.<ref name="NBB300"/> The most common method is [[fractional distillation]] of liquefied air, with {{chem|N|2}} [[distillation|distilling]] as a vapor while {{chem|O|2}} is left as a liquid.<ref name="NBB300"/>

The other primary method of producing {{chem|O|2}} is passing a stream of clean, dry air through one bed of a pair of identical [[zeolite]] molecular sieves, which absorbs the nitrogen and delivers a gas stream that is 90%&nbsp;to&nbsp;93% {{chem|O|2}}.<ref name="NBB300"/> Simultaneously, nitrogen gas is released from the other nitrogen-saturated zeolite bed, by reducing the chamber operating pressure and diverting part of the oxygen gas from the producer bed through it, in the reverse direction of flow. After a set cycle time the operation of the two beds is interchanged, thereby allowing for a continuous supply of gaseous oxygen to be pumped through a pipeline. This is known as [[pressure swing adsorption]]. Oxygen gas is increasingly obtained by these non-[[cryogenics|cryogenic]] technologies (see also the related [[vacuum swing adsorption]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uigi.com/noncryo.html|title=Non-Cryogenic Air Separation Processes|date=2003|accessdate=December 16, 2007|publisher=UIG Inc.}}</ref>

Oxygen gas can also be produced through [[electrolysis of water]] into molecular oxygen and hydrogen. DC electricity must be used: if AC is used, the gases in each limb consist of hydrogen and oxygen in the explosive ratio 2:1. A similar method is the electrocatalytic {{chem|O|2}} evolution from oxides and [[oxoacid]]s. Chemical catalysts can be used as well, such as in [[chemical oxygen generator]]s or oxygen candles that are used as part of the life-support equipment on submarines, and are still part of standard equipment on commercial airliners in case of depressurization emergencies. Another air separation method is forcing air to dissolve through [[ceramic]] membranes based on [[zirconium dioxide]] by either high pressure or an electric current, to produce nearly pure {{chem|O|2}} gas.<ref name="NBB301"/>

== Storage ==
[[File:Compressed gas cylinders.mapp and oxygen.triddle.jpg|thumb|Oxygen and [[MAPP gas]] compressed gas cylinders with regulators]]
[[Oxygen storage]] methods include high pressure [[oxygen tank]]s, cryogenics and chemical compounds. For reasons of economy, oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers, since one [[litre|liter]] of liquefied oxygen is equivalent to 840&nbsp;liters of gaseous oxygen at atmospheric pressure and {{convert|20|C|F}}.<ref name="NBB300"/> Such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers, which stand outside hospitals and other institutions that need large volumes of pure oxygen gas. Liquid oxygen is passed through [[heat exchanger]]s, which convert the cryogenic liquid into gas before it enters the building. Oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the compressed gas; a form that is useful in certain portable medical applications and [[oxy-fuel welding and cutting]].<ref name="NBB300"/>

Uptake of {{chem|O|2}} from the air is the essential purpose of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], so oxygen supplementation is used in [[medicine]].

An application of {{chem|O|2}} as a low-pressure [[breathing gas]] is in modern [[space suit]]s, which surround their occupant's body with the breathing gas. These devices use nearly pure oxygen at about one-third normal pressure, resulting in a normal blood partial pressure of {{chem|O|2}}. This trade-off of higher oxygen concentration for lower pressure is needed to maintain suit flexibility.<ref name="pmid11541018">{{cite journal|author=Morgenthaler GW|author2=Fester DA|author3=Cooley CG| title=As assessment of habitat pressure, oxygen fraction, and EVA suit design for space operations|journal=Acta Astronautica |volume= 32|issue=1|pages=39–49|date=1994|pmid=11541018|doi=10.1016/0094-5765(94)90146-5|bibcode = 1994AcAau..32...39M }}</ref><ref name="pmid2730484">{{cite journal|author=Webb JT|author2= Olson RM|author3=Krutz RW|author4=Dixon G|author5=Barnicott PT|title=Human tolerance to 100% oxygen at 9.5 psia during five daily simulated 8-hour EVA exposures|journal=Aviat Space Environ Med|volume=60|issue=5|pages=415–21|date=1989|pmid=2730484|doi=10.4271/881071}}</ref>

[[Scuba diving|Scuba]] and [[Surface-supplied diving|surface-supplied]] [[underwater divers]] and [[submarine]]rs also rely on artificially delivered {{chem|O|2}}. Submarines, submersibles and [[atmospheric diving suits]] usually operate at normal atmospheric pressure. Breathing air is scrubbed of carbon dioxide by chemical extraction and oxygen is replaced to maintain a constant partial pressure. [[Ambient pressure]] divers breathe air or gas mixtures with an oxygen fraction suited to the operating depth.

People who climb mountains or fly in non-pressurized [[fixed-wing aircraft]] sometimes have supplemental {{chem|O|2}} supplies.<ref group=lower-alpha>The reason is that increasing the proportion of oxygen in the breathing gas at low pressure acts to augment the inspired {{chem|O|2}} partial pressure nearer to that found at sea-level.</ref> Pressurized commercial airplanes have an emergency supply of {{chem|O|2}} automatically supplied to the passengers in case of cabin depressurization.

Oxygen, as a supposed mild [[euphoria|euphoric]], has a history of recreational use in [[oxygen bar]]s and in [[sport]]s.

===Oxides and other inorganic compounds===
<!-- DIRECT ALL FUTURE EXPANSION to [[Compounds of oxygen]]  -->
[[Water]] ({{chem|H|2|O}}) is an oxide of [[hydrogen]] and the most familiar oxygen compound. Hydrogen atoms are [[covalent bonding|covalently bonded]] to oxygen in a water molecule but also have an additional attraction (about 23.3&nbsp;kJ·mol<sup>−1</sup> per hydrogen atom) to an adjacent oxygen atom in a separate molecule.<ref>{{cite journal|first=P.|last=Maksyutenko|first2=T.

[[File:Rust screw.jpg|thumb|left|Oxides, such as [[iron oxide]] or [[rust]], form when oxygen combines with other elements.|alt=A rusty piece of a bolt.]]
Due to its [[electronegativity]], oxygen forms [[chemical bond]]s with almost all other elements to give corresponding [[oxide]]s. The surface of most metals, such as [[aluminium]] and [[titanium]], are oxidized in the presence of air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivates]] the metal and slows further [[corrosion]]. Many oxides of the [[transition metal]]s are [[non-stoichiometric compound]]s, with slightly less metal than the [[chemical formula]] would show. For example, the mineral [[Iron(II) oxide|FeO]] ([[wüstite]]) is written as {{chem|Fe|1&nbsp;−&nbsp;''x''|O}}, where ''x'' is usually around 0.05.<ref>{{cite book|first=Lesley E.|last=Smart|last2=Moore|first2=Elaine A. |title=Solid State Chemistry: An Introduction|edition=3rd |publisher=CRC Press|date=2005|page=214|isbn=978-0-7487-7516-3}}</ref>

Oxygen is present in the atmosphere in trace quantities in the form of [[carbon dioxide]] ({{chem|CO|2}}). The [[Earth's crust]]al [[Rock (geology)|rock]] is composed in large part of oxides of [[silicon]] ([[Silicon dioxide|silica]] {{chem|SiO|2}}, as found in [[granite]] and [[quartz]]), aluminium ([[aluminium oxide]] {{chem|Al|2|O|3}}, in [[bauxite]] and [[corundum]]), iron ([[iron(III) oxide]] {{chem|Fe|2|O|3}}, in [[hematite]] and [[rust]]), and [[calcium carbonate]] (in [[limestone]]). The rest of the Earth's crust is also made of oxygen compounds, in particular various complex [[silicate]]s (in [[silicate minerals]]). The Earth's mantle, of much larger mass than the crust, is largely composed of silicates of magnesium and iron.

Water-[[solubility|soluble]] silicates in the form of {{chem|Na|4|SiO|4}}, {{chem|Na|2|SiO|3}}, and {{chem|Na|2|Si|2|O|5}} are used as [[detergent]]s and [[adhesive]]s.<ref name="ECE507">[[#Reference-idCook1968|Cook & Lauer 1968]], p.507</ref>

Oxygen also acts as a [[ligand]] for transition metals, forming [[transition metal dioxygen complexes]], which feature metal–{{chem|O|2}}.  This class of compounds includes the [[heme]] proteins [[hemoglobin]] and [[myoglobin]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Crabtree|first=R.|title=The Organometallic Chemistry of the Transition Metals|edition=3rd |publisher=John Wiley & Sons|date=2001|page=152|isbn=978-0-471-18423-2}}</ref> An exotic and unusual reaction occurs with [[platinum hexafluoride|{{chem|PtF|6}}]], which oxidizes oxygen to give O<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>PtF<sub>6</sub><sup>−</sup>.<ref name="ECE505">[[#Reference-idCook1968|Cook & Lauer 1968]], p.505</ref>

Among the most important classes of organic compounds that contain oxygen are (where "R" is an organic group): [[alcohol]]s (R-OH); [[ether]]s (R-O-R); [[ketone]]s (R-CO-R); [[aldehyde]]s (R-CO-H); [[carboxylic acid]]s (R-COOH); [[ester]]s (R-COO-R); [[Organic acid anhydride|acid anhydride]]s (R-CO-O-CO-R); and [[amide]]s ({{chem|R-C(O)-NR|2}}). There are many important organic [[solvent]]s that contain oxygen, including: [[acetone]], [[methanol]], [[ethanol]], [[Isopropyl alcohol|isopropanol]], [[furan]], [[tetrahydrofuran|THF]], [[diethyl ether]], [[1,4-Dioxane|dioxane]], [[ethyl acetate]], [[dimethylformamide|DMF]], [[dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]], [[acetic acid]], and [[formic acid]]. Acetone ({{chem|(CH|3|)|2|CO}}) and [[phenol]] ({{chem|C|6|H|5|OH}}) are used as feeder materials in the synthesis of many different substances. Other important organic compounds that contain oxygen are: [[glycerol]], [[formaldehyde]], [[glutaraldehyde]], [[citric acid]], [[acetic anhydride]], and [[acetamide]]. [[Epoxide]]s are ethers in which the oxygen atom is part of a ring of three atoms. The element is similarly found in almost all [[biomolecule]]s that are important to (or generated by) life.

Oxygen reacts spontaneously with many [[organic chemistry|organic]] compounds at or below room temperature in a process called [[autoxidation]].<ref name="ECE506">[[#Reference-idCook1968|Cook & Lauer 1968]], p.506</ref> Most of the [[organic compound]]s that contain oxygen are not made by direct action of {{chem|O|2}}.

==Safety and precautions==
The [[NFPA 704]] standard rates compressed oxygen gas as nonhazardous to health, nonflammable and nonreactive, but an oxidizer. Refrigerated liquid oxygen (LOX) is given a health hazard rating of 3 (for increased risk of [[hyperoxia]] from condensed vapors, and for hazards common to cryogenic liquids such as frostbite), and all other ratings are the same as the compressed gas form.<ref name=nfpa>{{cite web|url = http://www.rivcoeh.org/Portals/0/documents/guidance/hazmat/bep_nfparatings.pdf|publisher =Riverside County Department of Environmental Health |accessdate=August 22, 2017 |title =NFPA 704 ratings and id numbers for common hazardous materials}}</ref>

[[File:Iceberg with hole near Sandersons Hope 2007-07-28 2.jpg|thumb|Water in two states: liquid (including the clouds, which are examples of [[aerosols]]), and solid ([[ice]]).]]

'''Water''' is a transparent and nearly colorless [[chemical substance]] that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the [[fluid]]s of most living [[organism]]s. Its [[chemical formula]] is '''H<sub>2</sub>O''', meaning that each of its [[molecule]]s contains one [[oxygen]] and two [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s that are connected by [[covalent bond]]s. Strictly speaking, water refers to the liquid state of a substance that prevails at [[standard ambient temperature and pressure]]; but it often refers also to its solid state ([[ice]]) or its gaseous state ([[steam]] or [[water vapor]]). It also occurs in nature as snow, [[glacier]]s, [[drift ice|ice packs]] and [[iceberg]]s, clouds, [[fog]], [[dew]], [[aquifer]]s, and atmospheric [[humidity]].

Water on Earth moves continually through the [[water cycle]] of [[evaporation]] and [[transpiration]] ([[evapotranspiration]]), [[condensation]], [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], and [[Surface runoff|runoff]], usually reaching the sea. Evaporation and transpiration contribute to the precipitation over land. Large amounts of water are also chemically combined or [[adsorption|adsorbed]] in [[Mineral hydration|hydrated minerals]].

[[File:SnowflakesWilsonBentley.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Snowflake]]s'' by [[Wilson Bentley]], 1902]]
[[File:Brindis (24675281395).jpg|thumb|left|Liquid water, showing droplets and air bubbles caused by the drops]]
Water is a liquid at the temperatures and pressures that are most adequate for life. Specifically, at a standard pressure of 1 [[atmosphere (unit)|atm]], water is a liquid between 0 °C (32 °F) and 100&nbsp;°C (212&nbsp;°F). Increasing the pressure slightly lowers the [[melting point]], which is about −5&nbsp;°C at 600 atm and −22&nbsp;°C at 2100 atm. This effect is relevant, for example, to [[ice skating]], to the [[Lake Vostok|buried lakes of Antarctica]], and to the movement of [[glacier]]s. (At pressures higher than 2100 atm the melting point rapidly increases again, and ice takes several exotic forms that do not exist at lower pressures.)

Increasing the pressure has a more dramatic effect on the [[boiling point]], that is about 374&nbsp;°C at 220 atm. This effect is important in, among other things, deep-sea [[hydrothermal vents]] and [[geyser]]s, [[pressure cooking]], and [[steam engine]] design. At the top of [[Mount Everest]], where the atmospheric pressure is about 0.34 atm, water boils at {{convert|68|°C}}.

At very low pressures (below about 0.006 atm), water cannot exist in the liquid state and passes directly from solid to gas by [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]—a phenomenon exploited in the [[freeze drying]] of food. At very high pressures (above 221 atm), the liquid and gas states are no longer distinguishable, a state called [[supercritical fluid|supercritical steam]].

Water also differs from most liquids in that it becomes less [[density|dense]] as it freezes. The maximum density of water in its liquid form (at 1&nbsp;atm) is {{convert|1000|kg/m3|lb/cuft|sigfig=4|abbr=on}}; that occurs at {{convert|3.98|°C}}.<ref name="NatureWaterStructure">{{Cite news |url=https://www.academia.edu/2230441/Water_Water_an_enduring_mystery |title=Water: Water—an enduring mystery|access-date=15 November 2016 |publisher=Nature}}</ref> The density of ice is {{convert|917|kg/m3|lb/cuft|sigfig=4|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kotz, J.

The details of the exact chemical nature of liquid water are not well understood; some theories suggest that water's unusual behaviour is as a result of it having 2 liquid states.<ref name="NatureWaterStructure" /><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Maestro |first=L.m. |last2=Marqués |first2=M.i. |last3=Camarillo |first3=E. |last4=Jaque |first4=D. |last5=Solé |first5=J.

===Taste and odor===

Pure water is usually described as tasteless and odorless, although humans have specific sensors that can feel the presence of water in their mouths,<ref name=emo>Edmund T. Rolls (2005), "Emotion Explained". Oxford University Press, Medical. {{ISBN|0198570031}}, 9780198570035.</ref> and frogs are known to be able to smell it.<ref name=frog>R. Llinas, W. Precht (2012), "Frog Neurobiology: A Handbook". Springer Science & Business Media. {{ISBN|3642663168}}, 9783642663161</ref> However, water from ordinary sources (including bottled mineral water) usually has many dissolved substances, that may give it varying tastes and odors. [[Humans]] and other animals have developed senses that enable them to evaluate the [[drinking water|potability]] of water by avoiding water that is too salty or [[putrid]].<ref name=candau>{{cite journal |last1=Candau |first1=Joël |year=2004 |title=The Olfactory Experience: constants and cultural variables |url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00130924 |journal=Water Science and Technology |volume=49 |issue=9 |pages=11–17}}</ref>

===Color and appearance===
The apparent color of natural bodies of water (and swimming pools) is often determined more by dissolved and suspended solids, or by reflection of the sky, than by water itself.

Light in the visible [[electromagnetic spectrum]] can traverse a couple meters of pure water (or ice) without significant [[optical absorption|absorption]], so that it looks [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] and colorless.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Braun |first=Charles L. |author2=Sergei N. Smirnov |title=Why is water blue? |journal=J. Chem. Educ. |volume=70 |issue=8 |page=612 |year=1993 |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~etrnsfer/water.htm |doi=10.1021/ed070p612 |bibcode=1993JChEd..70..612B}}</ref> Thus [[aquatic plant]]s, [[alga]]e, and other [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organisms can live in water up to hundreds of meters deep, because [[sunlight]] can reach them. Water vapour is essentially invisible as a gas.

Through a thickness of 10 meters or more, however, the intrinsic [[color of water]] (or ice) is visibly turquoise (greenish blue), as its [[electromagnetic absorption by water|absorption spectrum]] has a sharp minimum at the corresponding color of light (1/227 m<sup>−1</sup> at 418&nbsp;nm). The color becomes increasingly stronger and darker with increasing thickness. (Practically no sunlight reaches the parts of the oceans below 1000 meters of depth.) Infrared and ultraviolet light, on the other hand, is strongly [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] by water.

The [[refraction index]] of liquid water (1.333 at 20&nbsp;°C) is much higher than that of air (1.0), similar to those of [[alkane]]s and [[ethanol]], but lower than those of [[glycerol]] (1.473), [[benzene]] (1.501), [[carbon disulfide]] (1.627), and common types of glass (1.4 to 1.6). The refraction index of ice (1.31) is lower than that of liquid water.

===Polarity and hydrogen bonding===
{{See also|Chemical bonding of H2O}}
[[File:3D model hydrogen bonds in water.svg|left|thumb|Model of [[hydrogen bond]]s (1) between molecules of water.]]
[[File:Capillarity.svg|upright|thumb|[[Capillary action]] of water compared to [[Mercury (element)|mercury]].]]
[[File:Water drop 001.jpg|right|thumb|Impact from a water drop causes an upward "rebound" jet surrounded by circular [[capillary wave]]s.]]

Since the water molecule is not linear and the oxygen atom has a higher [[electronegativity]] than hydrogen atoms, it is a [[polar molecule]], with an [[electrical dipole moment]]: the oxygen atom carries a slight negative charge, whereas the hydrogen atoms are slightly positive. Water is a good polar [[solvent]], that dissolves many [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] and [[hydrophilic]] organic molecules such as sugars and simple alcohols such as [[ethanol]]. Most [[acid]]s dissolve in water to yield the corresponding [[anion]]s. Many substances in living organisms, such as [[protein]]s, [[DNA]] and [[polysaccharide]]s, are dissolved in water. Water also dissolves many gases, such as oxygen and [[carbon dioxide]]—the latter giving the fizz of [[carbonation|carbonated]] beverages, [[sparkling wine]]s and beers.

On the other hand, many organic substances (such as [[lipids|fats and oils]] and [[alkanes]]) are [[hydrophobic]], that is, insoluble in water. Many inorganic substances are insoluble too, including most metal [[oxide]]s, [[sulfide]]s, and [[silicate]]s.

Because of its polarity, a molecule of water in the liquid or solid state can form up to four [[hydrogen bonds]] with neighboring molecules. These bonds are the cause of water's high [[surface tension]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. |author2=Brad Williamson |author3=Robin J. Heyden |title=Biology: Exploring Life |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2006 |location=Boston, Massachusetts |url=http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html |isbn=0-13-250882-6}}</ref> and capillary forces. The [[capillary action]] refers to the tendency of water to move up a narrow tube against the force of [[gravity]]. This property is relied upon by all [[vascular plant]]s, such as trees.<ref>[http://science.jrank.org/pages/1182/Capillary-Action.html Capillary Action – Liquid, Water, Force, and Surface – JRank Articles]. Science.jrank.org. Retrieved on 28 September 2015.</ref>

The hydrogen bonds are also the reason why the melting and boiling points of water are much higher than those of [[Hydrogen chalcogenide|other analogous compounds]] like [[hydrogen sulfide]] ({{chem|H|2|S}}). They also explain its exceptionally high [[specific heat capacity]] (about 4.2 [[joule|J]]/g/K), [[heat of fusion]] (about 333 J/g), [[heat of vaporization]] ({{nowrap|2257 J/g}}), and [[thermal conductivity]] (between 0.561 and 0.679 W/m/K). These properties make water more effective at moderating Earth's [[climate]], by storing heat and transporting it between the oceans and the atmosphere. The hydrogen bonds of water are of moderate strength, around 23 kJ/mol (compared to a covalent O-H bond at 492 kJ/mol). Of this, it is estimated that 90% of the hydrogen bond is attributable to electrostatics, while the remaining 10% reflects partial covalent character.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1 March 2000|title=Compton scattering evidence for covalency of the hydrogen bond in ice|journal=Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids|volume=61|issue=3|pages=403–406|doi=10.1016/S0022-3697(99)00325-X|last1=Isaacs|first1=E.D|last2=Shukla|first2=A|last3=Platzman|first3=P.M|last4=Hamann|first4=D.R|last5=Barbiellini|first5=B|last6=Tulk|first6=C.A|bibcode=2000JPCS...61..403I}}</ref>

===Electrical conductivity and electrolysis===
Pure water has a low [[electrical conductivity]], which increases with the [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] of a small amount of ionic material such as [[sodium chloride|common salt]].

Liquid water can be split into the [[chemical element|elements]] hydrogen and oxygen by passing an electric current through it—a process called [[electrolysis of water|electrolysis]]. The decomposition requires more energy input than the [[standard enthalpy of formation|heat released by the inverse process]] (285.8 kJ/[[mole (unit)|mol]], or 15.9 MJ/kg).<ref>{{cite web |last=Ball |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Ball |title=Burning water and other myths |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070910/full/070910-13.html |work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] News |date=14 September 2007 |accessdate=14 September 2007}}</ref>

===Mechanical properties===

Liquid water can be assumed to be incompressible for most purposes: its compressibility ranges from 4.4 to {{val|5.1|e=-10|u=Pa<sup>−1</sup>}} in ordinary conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fine, R.A. |author2=Millero, F.J.|last-author-amp=yes |date=1973 |title=Compressibility of water as a function of temperature and pressure |volume=59 |issue=10 |page=5529 |journal=Journal of Chemical Physics |doi=10.1063/1.1679903 |bibcode=1973JChPh..59.5529F}}</ref> Even in oceans at 4&nbsp;km depth, where the pressure is 400 atm, water suffers only a 1.8% decrease in volume.<ref name = nave>{{cite web |title=Bulk Elastic Properties |author=Nave, R. |work=HyperPhysics |publisher=[[Georgia State University]] |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hph.html |accessdate=26 October 2007}}</ref>

The [[viscosity]] of water is about 10<sup>−3</sup> Pa·[[second|s]] or 0.01 [[poise]] at 20&nbsp;°C, and the [[speed of sound]] in liquid water ranges between 1400 and 1540&nbsp;m/s depending on temperature. Sound travels long distances in water with little attenuation, especially at low frequencies (roughly 0.03 [[decibel|dB]]/km for 1 k[[hertz|Hz]]), a property that is exploited by [[cetaceans]] and humans for communication and environment sensing ([[sonar]]).<ref name=NPLcalc>UK National Physical Laboratory, [http://resource.npl.co.uk/acoustics/techguides/seaabsorption/ Calculation of absorption of sound in seawater].  Online site, last accessed on 28 September 2016.</ref>

===Reactivity===
Elements which are more [[electropositivity|electropositive]] than hydrogen such as [[lithium]], [[sodium]], [[calcium]], [[potassium]] and [[caesium]] displace hydrogen from water, forming [[hydroxide]]s and releasing hydrogen.

[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface; the oceans contain 96.5% of the Earth's water. The [[Antarctic ice sheet]], which contains 61% of all fresh water on Earth, is visible at the bottom. Condensed atmospheric water can be seen as clouds, contributing to the Earth's [[albedo]].]]

Hydrology is the study of the movement, distribution, and quality of water throughout the Earth. The study of the distribution of water is [[hydrography]]. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is [[hydrogeology]], of glaciers is [[glaciology]], of inland waters is [[limnology]] and distribution of oceans is [[oceanography]]. Ecological processes with hydrology are in focus of [[ecohydrology]].

The collective mass of water found on, under, and over the surface of a planet is called the [[hydrosphere]]. Earth's approximate water volume (the total water supply of the world) is 1,338,000,000&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> (321,000,000&nbsp;mi<sup>3</sup>).<ref name=b1 />

Liquid water is found in [[body of water|bodies of water]], such as an ocean, sea, lake, river, stream, [[canal]], pond, or [[puddle]]. The majority of water on Earth is [[sea water]]. Water is also present in the atmosphere in solid, liquid, and vapor states. It also exists as groundwater in [[aquifer]]s.

Water is important in many geological processes. Groundwater is present in most [[rock (geology)|rocks]], and the pressure of this groundwater affects patterns of [[fault (geology)|faulting]]. Water in the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] is responsible for the melt that produces [[volcano]]es at [[subduction zone]]s. On the surface of the Earth, water is important in both chemical and physical [[weathering]] processes. Water, and to a lesser but still significant extent, ice, are also responsible for a large amount of [[sediment transport]] that occurs on the surface of the earth. [[Deposition (geology)|Deposition]] of transported sediment forms many types of [[sedimentary rock]]s, which make up the [[geologic record]] of [[History of the Earth|Earth history]].

===Water cycle===
{{Main article|Water cycle}}
[[File:Water cycle.png|thumb|[[Water cycle]]]]

The [[water cycle]] (known scientifically as the '''hydrologic cycle''') refers to the continuous exchange of water within the [[hydrosphere]], between the [[Earth atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[soil]] water, [[surface water]], [[groundwater]], and plants.

Water moves perpetually through each of these regions in the ''water cycle'' consisting of following transfer processes:
* [[evaporation]] from oceans and other water bodies into the air and [[transpiration]] from land plants and animals into air.
* [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], from water vapor condensing from the air and falling to earth or ocean.
* [[runoff (water)|runoff]] from the land usually reaching the sea.
Most water vapor over the oceans returns to the oceans, but winds carry water vapor over land at the same rate as runoff into the sea, about 47&nbsp;[[Metric tonne unit|Tt]] per year. Over land, evaporation and transpiration contribute another 72&nbsp;Tt per year. Precipitation, at a rate of 119 Tt per year over land, has several forms: most commonly rain, snow, and [[hail]], with some contribution from [[fog]] and [[dew]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Water in Crisis: A Guide to the World's Freshwater Resources |editor=Gleick, P.H. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |page=15, Table 2.3 |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/EarthSciences/Oceanography/?view=usa&ci=9780195076288 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408091921/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/EarthSciences/Oceanography/?view=usa&ci=9780195076288 |archivedate=8 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Dew is small drops of water that are condensed when a high density of water vapor meets a cool surface.

Water runoff often collects over [[Drainage basin|watersheds]] flowing into rivers. A mathematical model used to simulate river or stream flow and calculate water quality parameters is a [[hydrological transport model]]. Some water is diverted to [[irrigation]] for agriculture. Rivers and seas offer opportunity for travel and commerce. Through [[erosion]], runoff shapes the environment creating river [[valley]]s and [[river delta|deltas]] which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers. A flood occurs when an area of land, usually low-lying, is covered with water. It is when a river overflows its banks or flood comes from the sea. A drought is an extended period of months or years when a region notes a deficiency in its water supply. This occurs when a region receives consistently below average precipitation.

===Fresh water storage===

{{Main article|Water resources}}
Some runoff water is trapped for periods of time, for example in lakes.
At high altitude, during winter, and in the far north and south, snow collects in ice caps, snow pack and glaciers.
Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], or more spectacularly in [[hot spring]]s and [[geyser]]s. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in [[water well|wells]].
This water storage is important, since clean, fresh water is essential to human and other land-based life. In many parts of the world, it is in short supply.

===Sea water and tides===
{{Main article|Seawater|Tides}}
[[Seawater|Sea water]] contains about 3.5% [[sodium chloride]] on average, plus smaller amounts of other substances. The physical properties of sea water differ from fresh water in some important respects. It freezes at a lower temperature (about −1.9&nbsp;°C) and its density increases with decreasing temperature to the freezing point, instead of reaching maximum density at a temperature above freezing. The salinity of water in major seas varies from about 0.7% in the [[Baltic Sea]] to 4.0% in the [[Red Sea]]. (The [[Dead Sea]], known for its ultra-high salinity levels of between 30–40%, is really a [[salt lake]].)

[[Tide]]s are the cyclic rising and falling of local sea levels caused by the [[tidal force]]s of the Moon and the Sun acting on the oceans. Tides cause changes in the depth of the marine and [[estuary|estuarine]] water bodies and produce oscillating currents known as tidal streams.
The changing tide produced at a given location is the result of the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth coupled with the [[Coriolis effect|effects of Earth rotation]] and the local [[bathymetry]]. The strip of seashore that is submerged at high tide and exposed at low tide, the [[intertidal zone]], is an important ecological product of ocean tides.

==Effects on life==
[[File:Oasis in Lybia.JPG|thumb|left|An [[oasis]] is an isolated [[water source]] with vegetation in a [[desert]].]]
[[File:Auto-and heterotrophs.svg|thumb|right|Overview of [[photosynthesis|<span style="color:green;">photosynthesis</span>]] and [[cellular respiration|<span style="color:red;">respiration</span>]]. Water (at right), together with carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), form oxygen and organic compounds (at left), which can be respired to water and (CO<sub>2</sub>).]]

From a [[biology|biological]] standpoint, water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of life. It carries out this role by allowing [[organic compound]]s to react in ways that ultimately allow [[Self-replication|replication]]. All known forms of life depend on water. Water is vital both as a [[solvent]] in which many of the body's solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes within the body. Metabolism is the sum total of anabolism and catabolism. In anabolism, water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions) in order to grow larger molecules (e.g. starches, triglycerides and proteins for storage of fuels and information). In catabolism, water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (e.g. glucose, fatty acids and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes). Without water, these particular metabolic processes could not exist.

Water is fundamental to photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthetic cells use the sun's energy to split off water's hydrogen from oxygen. Hydrogen is combined with CO<sub>2</sub> (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose and release oxygen. All living cells use such fuels and oxidize the hydrogen and carbon to capture the sun's energy and reform water and CO<sub>2</sub> in the process (cellular respiration).

Water is also central to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function. An acid, a hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>, that is, a proton) donor, can be neutralized by a base, a proton acceptor such as a hydroxide ion (OH<sup>−</sup>) to form water. Water is considered to be neutral, with a [[pH]] (the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration) of 7. [[Acids]] have pH values less than 7 while [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] have values greater than 7.

===Aquatic life forms===
{{Further information|Hydrobiology|Marine life|Aquatic plant}}
[[File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|thumb|upright|Some of the [[biodiversity]] of a [[coral reef]]]]
[[File:Diatoms through the microscope.jpg|thumb|Some marine [[diatom]]s – a key [[phytoplankton]] group]]
Earth surface waters are filled with life. The earliest life forms appeared in water; nearly all fish live exclusively in water, and there are many types of marine mammals, such as dolphins and whales. Some kinds of animals, such as [[amphibian]]s, spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land. Plants such as [[kelp]] and [[algae]] grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. [[Plankton]] is generally the foundation of the ocean [[food chain]].

Aquatic vertebrates must obtain oxygen to survive, and they do so in various ways. Fish have [[gills]] instead of [[lungs]], although some species of fish, such as the [[lungfish]], have both. [[Marine mammal]]s, such as dolphins, whales, [[otter]]s, and [[pinniped|seals]] need to surface periodically to breathe air. Some amphibians are able to absorb oxygen through their skin. Invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters including breathing tubes (see [[Siphon (insect)|insect]] and [[Siphon (mollusc)|mollusc siphons]]) and [[gills]] (''[[Carcinus]]''). However as invertebrate life evolved in an aquatic habitat most have little or no specialisation for respiration in water.

==Effects on human civilization==
[[File:Longwood Gardens-Italian Garden.jpg|thumb|right|Water [[fountain]]]]
Civilization has historically flourished around rivers and major waterways; [[Mesopotamia]], the so-called cradle of civilization, was situated between the major rivers [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]]; the ancient society of the [[Egyptians]] depended entirely upon the [[Nile]]. Rome was also founded on the banks of the Italian river [[Tiber]]. Large [[metropolis]]es like [[Rotterdam]], London, Montreal, Paris, New York City, [[Buenos Aires]], Shanghai, Tokyo, Chicago, and Hong Kong owe their success in part to their easy accessibility via water and the resultant expansion of trade. Islands with safe water ports, like Singapore, have flourished for the same reason. In places such as North Africa and the Middle East, where water is more scarce, access to clean drinking water was and is a major factor in human development.

===Health and pollution===
[[File:Field Trip- water sampling.jpg|thumb|An environmental science program – a student from [[Iowa State University]] sampling water]]
Water fit for human consumption is called drinking water or [[potable water]]. Water that is not potable may be made potable by filtration or [[distillation]], or by a range of [[Water treatment|other methods]].

Water that is not fit for drinking but is not harmful for humans when used for swimming or bathing is called by various names other than potable or drinking water, and is sometimes called [[safe water]], or "safe for bathing". Chlorine is a skin and mucous membrane irritant that is used to make water safe for bathing or drinking. Its use is highly technical and is usually monitored by government regulations (typically 1 part per million (ppm) for drinking water, and 1–2 ppm of chlorine not yet reacted with impurities for bathing water). Water for bathing may be maintained in satisfactory microbiological condition using chemical disinfectants such as [[chlorine]] or [[ozone]] or by the use of [[ultraviolet]] light.

In the US, non-potable forms of [[wastewater]] generated by humans may be referred to as [[greywater]], which is treatable and thus easily able to be made potable again, and [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]], which generally contains [[sewage]] and other forms of waste which require [[Sewage treatment|further treatment]] in order to be made reusable. Greywater composes 50–80% of residential wastewater generated by a household's sanitation equipment ([[sink]]s, showers and kitchen runoff, but not toilets, which generate blackwater.) These terms may have different meanings in other countries and cultures.

This natural resource is becoming scarcer in certain places, and its availability is a major social and economic concern. Currently, about a billion people around the world routinely drink unhealthy water. Most countries accepted the goal of halving by 2015 the number of people worldwide who do not have access to safe water and [[sanitation]] during the [[29th G8 summit|2003 G8 Evian summit]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.g8.fr/evian/english/navigation/2003_g8_summit/summit_documents/water_-_a_g8_action_plan.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030608042310/http://www.g8.fr/evian/english/navigation/2003_g8_summit/summit_documents/water_-_a_g8_action_plan.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 June 2003 |title=G8 "Action plan" decided upon at the 2003 Evian summit |publisher=G8.fr |date=2 June 2003 |accessdate=25 July 2010 |df=}}</ref> Even if this difficult goal is met, it will still leave more than an estimated half a billion people without access to safe drinking water and over a billion without access to adequate sanitation. Poor [[water quality]] and bad sanitation are deadly; some five million deaths a year are caused by polluted drinking water. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that [[safe water]] could prevent 1.4 million child deaths from [[diarrhea]] each year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/features/qa/70/en/ |title=World Health Organization. Safe Water and Global Health |publisher=Who.int |date=25 June 2008 |accessdate=25 July 2010}}</ref>

Water, however, is not a finite resource (meaning the availability of water is limited), but rather re-circulated as potable water in precipitation<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=pba6tmIfiPgC&pg=PA1815 |title=The Water Footprint of Modern Consumer Society |last=Hoekstra |first=Arjen Y. |date=19 June 2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1136457046 }}</ref> in quantities many orders of magnitude higher than human consumption. Therefore, it is the relatively small quantity of water in reserve in the earth (about 1% of our drinking [[water supply]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}, which is replenished in aquifers around every 1 to 10 years){{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}, that is a [[non-renewable resource]], and it is, rather, the distribution of potable and irrigation water which is scarce{{clarify |date=January 2017 |reason= distribution can not be scarce, can be lacking, or inefficient, or unjust, or unfair}}, rather than the actual amount of it that exists on the earth. Water-poor countries use importation of goods as the primary method of importing water (to leave enough for local human consumption){{Elucidate|date=January 2017 |reason=water importation, via products? unclear for regular reader}}, since the manufacturing process{{clarify |date=January 2017 |reason= which manufacturing process?}} uses around 10 to 100 times products' masses in water.{{clarify |date=January 2017 |reason= this whole paragraph needs amendment}}

In the developing world, 90% of all [[wastewater]] still goes untreated into local rivers and streams.<ref>{{cite book |title=Environmentally Sound Technology for Wastewater and Stormwater Management: An International Source Book |author=UNEP International Environment |year=2002 |publisher=IWA Publishing |isbn=1-84339-008-6 |oclc=49204666}}</ref> Some 50 countries, with roughly a third of the world's population, also suffer from medium or high water stress, and 17 of these extract more water annually than is recharged through their natural water cycles.<ref>{{cite book |title=Climate Change and Developing Countries |last=Ravindranath |first=Nijavalli H. |author2=Jayant A.

====Agriculture====
[[File:Subsurface drip emission on loamy soil.ogv|thumb|Water distribution in subsurface [[drip irrigation]]]]
[[File:SiphonTubes.JPG|thumb|right|[[Irrigation]] of field crops]]

The most important use of water in agriculture is for [[irrigation]], which is a key component to produce enough food. Irrigation takes up to 90% of water withdrawn in some developing countries<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wbcsd.org/includes/getTarget.asp?type=d&id=MTYyNTA|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301011840/http://www.wbcsd.org/includes/getTarget.asp?type=d&id=MTYyNTA|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 March 2012 |title=WBCSD Water Facts & Trends |accessdate=25 July 2010}}</ref> and significant proportions in more economically developed countries (in the United States, 30% of freshwater usage is for irrigation).<ref name="Water Use in the United States">[http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/water/a_wateruse.html Water Use in the United States], National Atlas.gov  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814045418/http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/water/a_wateruse.html |date=14 August 2009 }}</ref>

Fifty years ago, the common perception was that water was an infinite resource. At the time, there were fewer than half the current number of people on the planet. People were not as wealthy as today, consumed fewer calories and ate less meat, so less water was needed to produce their food. They required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers. Today, the competition for the fixed amount of water resources is much more intense, giving rise to the concept of [[peak water]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gleick |first=P.H. |title=Peak Water |url=http://www.pacinst.org/press_center/press_releases/peak_water_pnas.pdf |accessdate=11 October 2011 |year=2010 |publisher=[[National Academy of Science]] |doi=10.1073/pnas.1004812107 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=107 |issue=125 |pages=11155–11162 |last2=Palaniappan |first2=M. |bibcode=2010PNAS..10711155G}}</ref> This is because there are now nearly seven billion people on the planet, their consumption of water-thirsty meat and vegetables is rising, and there is increasing competition for water from industry, urbanisation and biofuel crops. In future, even more water will be needed to produce food because the Earth's population is forecast to rise to 9 billion by 2050.<ref>United Nations Press Release POP/952 (13 March 2007). [https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/pop952.doc.htm World population will increase by 2.5 billion by 2050]</ref>

An assessment of water management in agriculture was conducted in 2007 by the [[International Water Management Institute]] in Sri Lanka to see if the world had sufficient water to provide food for its growing population.<ref>Molden, D. (Ed). ''Water for food, Water for life: A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture.'' Earthscan/IWMI, 2007.</ref> It assessed the current availability of water for agriculture on a global scale and mapped out locations suffering from water scarcity. It found that a fifth of the world's people, more than 1.2 billion, live in areas of [[physical water scarcity]], where there is not enough water to meet all demands. A further 1.6 billion people live in areas experiencing [[economic water scarcity]], where the lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity make it impossible for authorities to satisfy the demand for water. The report found that it would be possible to produce the food required in future, but that continuation of today's food production and environmental trends would lead to crises in many parts of the world. To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.<ref>Chartres, C. and Varma, S. (2010) ''Out of water. From Abundance to Scarcity and How to Solve the World's Water Problems''. FT Press (US).</ref>

Water scarcity is also caused by production of [[cotton]]: 1 kg of cotton—equivalent of a pair of jeans—requires 10.9 m<sup>3</sup> water to produce. While cotton accounts for 2.4% of world water use, the water is consumed in regions which are already at a risk of water shortage. Significant environmental damage has been caused, such as disappearance of the [[Aral Sea]].<ref>waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Report18.pdf</ref>

====As a scientific standard====
On 7 April 1795, the gram was defined in France to be equal to "the absolute weight of a volume of pure water equal to a cube of one hundredth of a meter, and at the temperature of melting ice".<ref>[http://smdsi.quartier-rural.org/histoire/18germ_3.htm Décret relatif aux poids et aux mesures. 18 germinal an 3 (7 April 1795)]. Decree relating to the weights and measurements (in French). quartier-rural.org</ref> For practical purposes though, a metallic reference standard was required, one thousand times more massive, the kilogram. Work was therefore commissioned to determine precisely the mass of one liter of water. In spite of the fact that the decreed definition of the gram specified water at 0&nbsp;°C—a highly reproducible ''temperature''—the scientists chose to redefine the standard and to perform their measurements at the temperature of highest water ''density'', which was measured at the time as {{convert|4|C}}.<ref>[http://histoire.du.metre.free.fr/fr/index.htm here L'Histoire Du Mètre, La Détermination De L'Unité De Poids]. histoire.du.metre.free.fr</ref>

The [[Kelvin temperature scale]] of the SI system is based on the [[triple point]] of water, defined as exactly 273.16&nbsp;K or 0.01&nbsp;°C. The scale is an [[absolute temperature]] scale with the same increment as the Celsius temperature scale, which was originally defined according to the [[boiling point]] (set to 100&nbsp;°C) and [[melting point]] (set to 0&nbsp;°C) of water.

Natural water consists mainly of the isotopes hydrogen-1 and oxygen-16, but there is also a small quantity of heavier isotopes such as hydrogen-2 ([[deuterium]]). The amount of deuterium oxides or [[heavy water]] is very small, but it still affects the properties of water. Water from rivers and lakes tends to contain less deuterium than seawater. Therefore, standard water is defined in the [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]] specification.

The [[human body]] contains from 55% to 78% water, depending on body size.<ref>[http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/2000-05/958588306.An.r.html Re: What percentage of the human body is composed of water?] Jeffrey Utz, M.D., The MadSci Network</ref> To function properly, the body requires between one and seven liters of water per day to avoid [[dehydration]]; the precise amount depends on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. Most of this is ingested through foods or beverages other than drinking straight water. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people, though most specialists agree that approximately 2 liters (6 to 7 glasses) of water daily is the minimum to maintain proper hydration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/healthy_living/nutrition/drinks_water.shtml |title=Healthy Water Living |publisher=BBC |accessdate=1 February 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101100025/http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/healthy_living/nutrition/drinks_water.shtml |archivedate=1 January 2007}}</ref> Medical literature favors a lower consumption, typically 1 liter of water for an average male, excluding extra requirements due to fluid loss from exercise or warm weather.<ref name=Rhoades_2003>{{cite book |vauthors=Rhoades RA, Tanner GA |title=Medical Physiology |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |edition=2nd |location=Baltimore |year=2003 |isbn=0-7817-1936-4 |oclc=50554808}}</ref>

For those who have healthy kidneys, it is rather difficult to drink too much water, but (especially in warm humid weather and while exercising) it is dangerous to drink too little.

Specifically, pregnant and [[breastfeeding]] women need additional fluids to stay hydrated. The [[Institute of Medicine]] (US) recommends that, on average, men consume 3.0 liters and women 2.2 liters; pregnant women should increase intake to 2.4 liters (10 cups) and breastfeeding women should get 3 liters (12 cups), since an especially large amount of fluid is lost during nursing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/water/NU00283 |title=Water: How much should you drink every day? |publisher=Mayoclinic.com |accessdate=25 July 2010}}</ref> Also noted is that normally, about 20% of water intake comes from food, while the rest comes from drinking water and beverages ([[Caffeine|caffeinated]] included). Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms; through [[urine]] and [[feces]], through [[sweat]]ing, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath. With physical exertion and heat exposure, water loss will increase and daily fluid needs may increase as well.

====Washing====
The propensity of water to form [[Solvation|solutions]] and [[emulsion]]s is useful in various [[washing]] processes. Washing is also an important component of several aspects of personal [[body hygiene]]. Most of personal water use is due to [[shower]]ing, doing the [[laundry]] and [[dishwashing]], reaching hundreds of liters per day in developed countries.

====Transportation====
{{Main article|Ship transport}}
The use of water for transportation of materials through rivers and canals as well as the international shipping lanes is an important part of the world economy.

====Chemical uses====
Water is widely used in chemical reactions as a [[solvent]] or [[reactant]] and less commonly as a [[solution|solute]] or [[catalyst]]. In inorganic reactions, water is a common solvent, dissolving many ionic compounds, as well as other polar compounds such as [[ammonia]] and [[Hydrogen chalcogenide|compounds closely related to water]]. In organic reactions, it is not usually used as a reaction solvent, because it does not dissolve the reactants well and is [[amphoteric]] (acidic ''and'' basic) and [[nucleophilic]]. Nevertheless, these properties are sometimes desirable. Also, acceleration of [[Diels-Alder reaction]]s by water has been observed. [[Supercritical water]] has recently been a topic of research. Oxygen-saturated supercritical water combusts organic pollutants efficiently. Water vapor is used for some processes in the chemical industry. An example is the production of acrylic acid from acrolein, propylene and propane<ref>{{cite journal|title=The reaction network in propane oxidation over phase-pure MoVTeNb M1 oxide catalysts|journal=Journal of Catalysis|date=2014|volume=311|pages=369–385|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1896844:6/component/escidoc:1896843/JCAT-13-716_revised_06Dec2013.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Surface chemistry of phase-pure M1 MoVTeNb oxide during operation in selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid|journal=Journal of Catalysis|date=2012|volume=285|pages=48–60|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1108560:8/component/escidoc:1402724/1108560.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Kinetic studies of propane oxidation on Mo and V based mixed oxide catalysts|date=2011|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1199619:5/component/escidoc:1199618/csepei_lenard.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Multifunctionality of Crystalline MoV(TeNb) M1 Oxide Catalysts in Selective Oxidation of Propane and Benzyl Alcohol|journal=ACS Catalysis|date=2013|volume=3|issue=6|pages=1103–1113|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278196177_Multifunctionality_of_Crystalline_MoVTeNb_M1_Oxide_Catalysts_in_Selective_Oxidation_of_Propane_and_Benzyl_Alcohol}}</ref>. The possible effect of water in these reactions includes the physical-, chemical interaction of water with the catalyst and the chemical reaction of water with the reaction intermediates.

====Heat exchange====
Water and steam are a common fluid used for [[heat exchanger|heat exchange]], due to its availability and high [[Heat capacity of water|heat capacity]], both for cooling and heating. Cool water may even be naturally available from a lake or the sea. It's especially effective to transport heat through [[vaporization]] and [[condensation]] of water because of its large [[latent heat of vaporization]]. A disadvantage is that metals commonly found in industries such as steel and copper are [[oxidation|oxidized]] faster by untreated water and steam. In almost all [[thermal power station]]s, water is used as the working fluid (used in a closed loop between boiler, steam turbine and condenser), and the coolant (used to exchange the waste heat to a water body or carry it away by [[evaporation]] in a [[cooling tower]]). In the United States, cooling power plants is the largest use of water.<ref name="Water Use in the United States" />

In the [[nuclear power]] industry, water can also be used as a [[neutron moderator]]. In most [[nuclear reactor]]s, water is both a coolant and a moderator. This provides something of a passive safety measure, as removing the water from the reactor also [[void coefficient|slows the nuclear reaction down]]. However other methods are favored for stopping a reaction and it is preferred to keep the nuclear core covered with water so as to ensure adequate cooling.

====Fire extinction====
[[File:MH-60S Helicopter dumps water onto Fire.jpg|right|thumb|Water is used for [[fire fighting|fighting]] [[wildfire]]s.]]
Water has a high heat of vaporization and is relatively inert, which makes it a good [[Fire fighting#Use of water|fire extinguishing]] fluid. The evaporation of water carries heat away from the fire. It is dangerous to use water on fires involving oils and organic solvents, because many organic materials float on water and the water tends to spread the burning liquid.

Use of water in fire fighting should also take into account the hazards of a [[steam explosion]], which may occur when water is used on very hot fires in confined spaces, and of a hydrogen explosion, when substances which react with water, such as certain metals or hot carbon such as coal, [[charcoal]], or [[coke (fuel)|coke]] graphite, decompose the water, producing [[water gas]].

The power of such explosions was seen in the [[Chernobyl disaster]], although the water involved did not come from fire-fighting at that time but the reactor's own water cooling system. A steam explosion occurred when the extreme overheating of the core caused water to flash into steam. A hydrogen explosion may have occurred as a result of reaction between steam and hot [[zirconium]].

====Recreation====
{{Main article|Water sport (recreation)}}
[[File:Grand Anse Beach Grenada.jpg|thumb|right|Grand Anse Beach, St. George's, [[Grenada]], [[West Indies]]]]

Humans use water for many recreational purposes, as well as for exercising and for sports. Some of these include swimming, [[waterskiing]], [[boating]], [[surfing]] and [[diving]]. In addition, some sports, like [[ice hockey]] and [[ice skating]], are played on ice. Lakesides, beaches and [[water park]]s are popular places for people to go to relax and enjoy recreation. Many find the sound and appearance of flowing water to be calming, and fountains and other water features are popular decorations. Some keep fish and other life in [[aquarium]]s or ponds for show, fun, and companionship. Humans also use water for snow sports i.e. [[skiing]], [[sledding]], [[snowmobiling]] or [[snowboarding]], which require the water to be frozen.

====Water industry====
[[File:Water carrier in India.jpg|thumb|upright|A water-carrier in India, 1882. In many places where running water is not available, water has to be transported by people.]]
[[File:TapWater-china.JPG|thumb|A manual water [[pump]] in China]]
[[File:Usine Bret MG 1648.jpg|thumb|[[Water purification]] facility]]
[[File:Reverse osmosis desalination plant.JPG|thumb|[[Reverse osmosis]] (RO) [[desalination]] plant in [[Barcelona]], Spain]]

The [[water industry]] provides drinking water and [[wastewater]] services (including [[sewage treatment]]) to households and industry. [[Water supply]] facilities include [[water well]]s, [[cistern]]s for [[rainwater harvesting]], [[water supply network]]s, and [[water purification]] facilities, [[water tank]]s, [[water tower]]s, [[water pipe]]s including old [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]]. [[Atmospheric water generator]]s are in development.

Drinking water is often collected at [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], extracted from artificial [[Boring (earth)|borings]] (wells) in the ground, or pumped from lakes and rivers. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water, assuming the aquifers can supply an adequate flow. Other water sources include rainwater collection. Water may require purification for human consumption. This may involve removal of undissolved substances, dissolved substances and harmful [[microbe]]s. Popular methods are [[filter (water)|filtering]] with sand which only removes undissolved material, while [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] and [[boiling]] kill harmful microbes. [[Distillation]] does all three functions. More advanced techniques exist, such as [[reverse osmosis]]. [[Desalination]] of abundant [[seawater]] is a more expensive solution used in coastal [[arid]] [[climate]]s.

The distribution of drinking water is done through [[municipal water system]]s, tanker delivery or as [[bottled water]]. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge.

Reducing usage by using drinking (potable) water only for human consumption is another option. In some cities such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to [[Water conservation|conserve fresh water resources]].

[[Water pollution|Polluting water]] may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter. Like other types of pollution, this does not enter standard accounting of market costs, being conceived as [[externality|externalities]] for which the market cannot account. Thus other people pay the price of water pollution, while the private firms' profits are not redistributed to the local population, victims of this pollution. [[Pharmaceuticals]] consumed by humans often end up in the waterways and can have detrimental effects on [[marine biology|aquatic]] life if they [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] and if they are not [[biodegradable]].

Municipal and industrial wastewater are typically treated at [[wastewater treatment plant]]s. Mitigation of polluted [[surface runoff]] is addressed through a variety of prevention and treatment techniques. (''See'' [[Surface runoff#Mitigation and treatment]].)

====Industrial applications====
Many industrial processes rely on reactions using chemicals dissolved in water, suspension of solids in water [[slurry|slurries]] or using water to dissolve and extract substances, or to wash products or process equipment. Processes such as [[mining]], [[chemical pulping]], [[pulp bleaching]], [[paper manufacturing]], textile production, dyeing, printing, and cooling of power plants use large amounts of water, requiring a dedicated water source, and often cause significant water pollution.

Water is used in [[power generation]]. [[Hydroelectricity]] is electricity obtained from [[hydropower]]. Hydroelectric power comes from water driving a water turbine connected to a generator. Hydroelectricity is a low-cost, non-polluting, renewable energy source. The energy is supplied by the motion of water. Typically a dam is constructed on a river, creating an artificial lake behind it. Water flowing out of the lake is forced through turbines that turn generators.

{{wide image|200407-sandouping-sanxiadaba-4.med.jpg|800px|[[Three Gorges Dam]] is the [[List of the largest hydroelectric power stations|largest hydro-electric power station]].}}

Pressurized water is used in [[Hydrodemolition|water blasting]] and [[water jet cutter]]s. Also, very high pressure water guns are used for precise cutting. It works very well, is relatively safe, and is not harmful to the environment. It is also used in the cooling of machinery to prevent overheating, or prevent saw blades from overheating.

Water is also used in many industrial processes and machines, such as the [[steam turbine]] and [[heat exchanger]], in addition to its use as a chemical [[solvent]]. Discharge of untreated water from industrial uses is [[water pollution|pollution]]. Pollution includes discharged solutes (chemical pollution) and discharged coolant water ([[thermal pollution]]). Industry requires pure water for many applications and utilizes a variety of purification techniques both in water supply and discharge.

====Food processing====
[[File:Cuisson des pates.jpg|thumb|Water can be used to cook foods such as [[noodles]]]]

[[Boiling]], [[steaming]], and [[simmering]] are popular cooking methods that often require immersing food in water or its gaseous state, steam.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xZHUAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA54|title=A Course in Household Arts: Part I|last=Duff|first=Sister Loretto Basil|date=1916|publisher=Whitcomb & Barrows}}</ref> Water is also used for [[dishwashing]]. Water also plays many critical roles within the field of [[food science]]. It is important for a food scientist to understand the roles that water plays within food processing to ensure the success of their products.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

[[Solution|Solutes]] such as salts and sugars found in water affect the physical properties of water. The boiling and freezing points of water are affected by solutes, as well as [[air pressure]], which is in turn is affected by altitude. Water boils at lower temperatures with the lower air pressure that occurs at higher elevations. One [[mole (unit)|mole]] of sucrose (sugar) per kilogram of water raises the boiling point of water by 0.51&nbsp;°C (0.918&nbsp;°F), and one mole of salt per kg raises the boiling point by 1.02&nbsp;°C (1.836&nbsp;°F); similarly, increasing the number of dissolved particles lowers water's freezing point.<ref name="vaclacik">{{cite book |title=Essentials of Food Science |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iCCsvwZrguUC&printsec=frontcover |year=2007 |author1=Vaclavik, Vickie A. |author2=Christian, Elizabeth W |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-387-69939-2}}</ref>

Solutes in water also affect water activity that affects many chemical reactions and the growth of microbes in food.<ref name="deman">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kDYJ7a1HbD0C&pg=PA434 |title=Principles of Food Chemistry |year=1999 |author=DeMan, John M |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-8342-1234-X}}</ref> Water activity can be described as a ratio of the vapor pressure of water in a solution to the vapor pressure of pure water.<ref name="vaclacik" /> Solutes in water lower water activity—this is important to know because most bacterial growth ceases at low levels of water activity.<ref name="deman" /> Not only does microbial growth affect the safety of food, but also the preservation and shelf life of food.

Water hardness is also a critical factor in food processing and may be altered or treated by using a chemical ion exchange system. It can dramatically affect the quality of a product, as well as playing a role in sanitation. Water hardness is classified based on concentration of calcium carbonate the water contains. Water is classified as soft if it contains less than 100&nbsp;mg/l (UK)<ref name="DEFRA">{{cite web |url=http://dwi.defra.gov.uk/consumers/advice-leaflets/hardness_map.pdf |title=Map showing the rate of hardness in mg/l as Calcium carbonate in England and Wales |publisher=DEFRA/ Drinking Water Inspectorate |date=2009}}</ref> or less than 60&nbsp;mg/l (US).<ref name="USGS">{{cite web |url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/hardness.html |publisher=US Geological Service |title=Water hardness |date=8 April 2014}}</ref>

According to a report published by the Water Footprint organization in 2010, a single kilogram of beef requires 15 thousand litres of water; however, the authors also make clear that this is a global average and circumstantial factors determine the amount of water used in beef production.<ref>{{cite web |title=The green, blue and grey water footprint of farm animals and animal products, Value of Water Research Report Series No. 48 – Volume 1: Main report |url=http://www.waterfootprint.org/Reports/Report-48-WaterFootprint-AnimalProducts-Vol1.pdf |work=The green, blue and grey water footprint of farm animals and animal products, Value of Water Research Report Series No. 48 – Volume 1: Main report |publisher=UNESCO – IHE Institute for Water Education |accessdate=30 January 2014 |author=M.M.

Much of the universe's water is produced as a byproduct of [[star formation]]. The formation of stars is accompanied by a strong outward wind of gas and dust. When this outflow of material eventually impacts the surrounding gas, the shock waves that are created compress and heat the gas. The water observed is quickly produced in this warm dense gas.<ref>Melnick, Gary, [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] and Neufeld, David, [[Johns Hopkins University]] quoted in:

====Exotic forms====
Water and other [[volatiles]] probably comprise much of the internal structures of [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]] and the water in the deeper layers may be in the form of [[ionic water]] in which the molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper still as [[superionic water]] in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions float about freely within the oxygen lattice.<ref name="newscientist.com">[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727764.500-weird-water-lurking-inside-giant-planets.html Weird water lurking inside giant planets], ''New Scientist'', 1 September 2010, Magazine issue 2776.</ref>

===Water and habitable zone===
{{Further information|Water distribution on Earth}}

The existence of liquid water, and to a lesser extent its gaseous and solid forms, on Earth are vital to the existence of [[Organism|life on Earth]] as we know it. The Earth is located in the [[habitable zone]] of the [[solar system]]; if it were slightly closer to or farther from the [[Sun]] (about 5%, or about 8 million kilometers), the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would be far less likely to exist.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=J. C. I. Dooge. "Integrated Management of Water Resources" |editor1=Ehlers, E. |editor2=Krafft, T |title=Understanding the Earth System: compartments, processes, and interactions |publisher=Springer |year=2001 |page=116}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Habitable Zone |url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/H/habzone.html |work=The Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, Astronomy and Spaceflight}}</ref>

Earth's [[gravity]] allows it to hold an [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]]. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provide a temperature buffer ([[greenhouse effect]]) which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were smaller, a thinner atmosphere would allow temperature extremes, thus preventing the accumulation of water except in [[polar ice cap]]s (as on [[Mars]]).

The surface temperature of Earth has been relatively constant through [[geologic time]] despite varying levels of incoming solar radiation ([[insolation]]), indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric [[albedo]]. This proposal is known as the ''[[Gaia hypothesis]]''.

The state of water on a planet depends on ambient pressure, which is determined by the planet's gravity. If a planet is sufficiently massive, the water on it may be solid even at high temperatures, because of the high pressure caused by gravity, as it was observed on exoplanets [[Gliese 436 b]]<ref>{{cite news |magazine=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11864-strange-alien-world-made-of-hot-ice-and-steam.html |title=Strange alien world made of "hot ice" |date=6 May 2007 |first=David |last=Shiga |accessdate=28 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706143705/http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn11864-strange-alien-world-made-of-hot-ice-and-steam.html |archivedate=6 July 2008}}</ref> and [[GJ 1214 b]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2009/pr200924.html |title=Astronomers Find Super-Earth Using Amateur, Off-the-Shelf Technology |author=Aguilar, David A. |date=16 December 2009 |publisher=Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics |accessdate=28 March 2010}}</ref>

==Law, politics, and crisis==

[[File:Access to drinking water in third world.svg|thumb|300px|An estimate of the share of people in developing countries with access to [[potable water]] 1970–2000]]

[[Water politics]] is politics affected by water and [[water resources]]. For this reason, water is a strategic resource in the globe and an important element in many political conflicts. It causes health impacts and damage to biodiversity.

1.6 billion people have gained access to a safe water source since 1990.<ref>[http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Resources/Static/Products/Progress2008/MDG_Report_2008_En.pdf#page=44 The Millennium Development Goals Report], United Nations, 2008</ref> The proportion of people in developing countries with access to safe water is calculated to have improved from 30% in 1970<ref name=lomborg>{{cite book |author=Lomborg, Björn |year=2001 |title=The Skeptical Environmentalist |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-01068-3 |url=http://www.lomborg.com/dyn/files/basic_items/69-file/skeptenvironChap1.pdf |page=22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725173040/http://www.lomborg.com/dyn/files/basic_items/69-file/skeptenvironChap1.pdf |archivedate=25 July 2013}}</ref> to 71% in 1990, 79% in 2000 and 84% in 2004.

This goal is projected to be reached.

A 2006 United Nations report stated that "there is enough water for everyone", but that access to it is hampered by mismanagement and corruption.<ref>[[UNESCO]], (2006), [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001444/144409E.pdf Water, a shared responsibility. The United Nations World Water Development Report 2].</ref> In addition, global initiatives to improve the efficiency of aid delivery, such as the [[Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness]], have not been taken up by water sector donors as effectively as they have in education and health, potentially leaving multiple donors working on overlapping projects and recipient governments without empowerment to act.<ref>Welle, Katharina; Evans, Barbara; Tucker, Josephine and Nicol, Alan (2008) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/download/1894.pdf ''Is water lagging behind on Aid Effectiveness?'']</ref>

The authors of the 2007 [[Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture]] cited poor governance as one reason for some forms of water scarcity. Water governance is the set of formal and informal processes through which decisions related to water management are made. Good water governance is primarily about knowing what processes work best in a particular physical and socioeconomic context. Mistakes have sometimes been made by trying to apply 'blueprints' that work in the developed world to developing world locations and contexts. The Mekong river is one example; a review by the [[International Water Management Institute]] of policies in six countries that rely on the Mekong river for water found that thorough and transparent cost-benefit analyses and environmental impact assessments were rarely undertaken. They also discovered that Cambodia's draft water law was much more complex than it needed to be.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/index.aspx |title=Search Results |work=International Water Management Institute (IWMI) |accessdate=3 March 2016}}</ref>

The [[UN World Water Development Report]] (WWDR, 2003) from the [[World Water Assessment Program]] indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal [[hygiene]]. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from [[waterborne diseases]] (related to the consumption of contaminated water) or drought. In 2004, the UK charity [[WaterAid]] reported that a child dies every 15 seconds from easily preventable water-related diseases; often this means lack of [[sewage]] disposal; see toilet.

Organizations concerned with water protection include the [[International Water Association]] (IWA), [[WaterAid]], [[Water 1st]], and the American Water Resources Association. The [[International Water Management Institute]] undertakes projects with the aim of using effective water management to reduce poverty. Water related conventions are [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD), [[International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships]], [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] and [[Ramsar Convention]]. [[World Day for Water]] takes place on 22 March and [[World Ocean Day]] on 8 June.

==In culture==

===Religion===
{{Main article|Water and religion}}
Water is considered a purifier in most religions. Faiths that incorporate ritual washing ([[Ritual purification|ablution]]) include Christianity, [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], the [[Rastafari movement]], [[Shinto]], [[Taoism]], and [[Wicca]]. Immersion (or [[aspersion]] or [[affusion]]) of a person in water is a central [[sacrament]] of Christianity (where it is called [[baptism]]); it is also a part of the practice of other religions, including Islam (''[[Ghusl]]''), Judaism (''[[mikvah]]'') and [[Sikhism]] (''[[Amrit Sanskar]]''). In addition, a ritual bath in pure water is performed for the dead in many religions including Islam and Judaism. In Islam, the five daily prayers can be done in most cases after completing washing certain parts of the body using clean water (''[[wudu]]''), unless water is unavailable (see ''[[Tayammum]]''). In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area (e.g., in the ritual of ''[[misogi]]'').

In Christianity, [[holy water]] is water that has been sanctified by a priest for the purpose of [[baptism]], the [[Blessing (Roman Catholic Church)|blessing]] of persons, places, and objects, or as a means of repelling evil.<ref>''Chambers's encyclopædia'', Lippincott & Co (1870). p. 394.</ref><ref>Altman, Nathaniel (2002) ''Sacred water: the spiritual source of life''. pp. 130–133. {{ISBN|1-58768-013-0}}.</ref>

===Philosophy===
The Ancient Greek philosopher [[Empedocles]] held that water is one of the four [[classical elements]] along with fire, earth and [[Air (classical element)|air]], and was regarded as the [[ylem]], or basic substance of the universe. [[Thales]], who was portrayed by Aristotle as an astronomer and an engineer, theorized that the earth, which is denser than water, emerged from the water. Thales, a [[monist]], believed further that all things are made from water. Plato believed the shape of water is an [[icosahedron]] which accounts for why it is able to flow easily compared to the cube-shaped earth.<ref>Lindberg, D. (2008). ''The beginnings of western science: The European scientific tradition in philosophical, religious, and institutional context, prehistory to A.D. 1450''. (2nd ed.). Chicago: University of Chicago Press.</ref>

In the theory of the [[humorism|four bodily humors]], water was associated with [[phlegm]], as being cold and moist. The [[Water (classical element)|classical element of water]] was also one of the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|five elements]] in traditional [[Chinese philosophy]], along with [[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[fire (classical element)|fire]], [[wood (classical element)|wood]], and [[metal (classical element)|metal]].

Water is also taken as a role model in some parts of traditional and popular Asian philosophy. James Legge's 1891 translation of the ''Dao De Jing'' states, "The highest excellence is like (that of) water. The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike. Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Tao" and "There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it—for there is nothing (so effectual) for which it can be changed."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/tao/taote.htm |title=Internet Sacred Text Archive Home |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=25 July 2010}}</ref> ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'' in "Shui di" 水地 chapter further elaborates on symbolism of water, proclaiming that "man is water" and attributing natural qualities of the people of different Chinese regions to the character of local water resources.<ref>[http://ctext.org/guanzi/shui-di Guanzi : Shui Di – Chinese Text Project].

'''Ferrochelatase''' (or protoporphyrin ferrochelatase) is an [[enzyme]] that is encoded by the '''FECH''' gene in humans.<ref>http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P22830</ref> Ferrochelatase catalyses the eighth and terminal step in the biosynthesis of [[heme]], converting [[protoporphyrin IX]] into [[heme B]]. It catalyses the reaction:
:[[protoporphyrin IX|protoporphyrin]] + Fe<sup>+2</sup> ↔ [[heme B]] + 2 H<sup>+</sup>

== Function ==

[[Image:Heme synthesis.png|right|framed|Summary of heme B biosynthesis—note that some reactions occur in the [[cytoplasm]] and some in the [[mitochondrion]] (yellow)]]

Ferrochelatase catalyzes the insertion of [[ferrous]] iron into protoporphyrin IX in the heme biosynthesis pathway to form heme B. The enzyme is localized to the matrix-facing side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Ferrochelatase is the best known member of a family of enzymes that add [[valence (chemistry)|divalent]] metal [[cations]] to tetrapyrrole structures.<ref name="Lecerof 2000" /> For example, [[magnesium chelatase]] adds [[magnesium]] to protoporphyrin IX in the first step of [[bacteriochlorophyll]] biosynthesis.<ref name="Leeper">{{cite journal|last1=Leeper|first1=F.

Heme B is an essential [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] in many proteins and enzymes. In particular, heme b plays a key role as the oxygen carrier in [[hemoglobin]] in [[red blood cell]]s and [[myoglobin]] in [[muscle]] cells. Furthermore, heme B is found in [[cytochrome b]], a key component in [[Q-cytochrome c oxidoreductase]] (complex III) in [[oxidative phosphorylation]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Berg|first1=Jeremy|last2=Tymoczko|first2=John|last3=Stryer|first3=Lubert|title=Biochemistry|date=2012|publisher=W.H.

Residues 1–62 form a mitochondrial localization domain that is cleaved in [[post-translational modification]]. The folded domains contain a total of 17 [[α-helices]] and 8 [[β-sheets]]. The C terminal extension contains three of the four [[cysteine]] residues (Cys403, Cys406, Cys411) that coordinate the catalytic [[iron-sulfur protein|iron-sulfur cluster (2Fe-2S)]]. The fourth coordinating cysteine resides in the N-terminal domain (Cys196).<ref name="Wu 2001">{{cite journal|last1=Wu|first1=Chia-Kuei|last2=Dailey|first2=Harry A.|last3=Rose|first3=John P.|last4=Burden|first4=Amy|last5=Sellers|first5=Vera M.|last6=Wang|first6=Bi-Cheng|title=The 2.0 Å structure of human ferrochelatase, the terminal enzyme of heme biosynthesis|journal=Nature Structural Biology|date=1 February 2001|volume=8|issue=2|pages=156–160|doi=10.1038/84152|pmid=11175906}}<!--|accessdate=20 February 2016--></ref>

The active pocket of ferrocheltase consists of two hydrophobic "lips" and a hydrophilic interior. The hydrophobic lips, consisting of the highly conserved residues 300–311, face the inner mitochondrial membrane and facilitate the passage of the poorly soluble protoporphyrin IX substrate and the heme product via the membrane. The interior of the active site pocket contains a highly conserved acidic surface that facilitates proton extraction from protoporphyrin. Histidine and [[aspartate]] residues roughly 20 angstroms from the center of the active site on the mitochondrial matrix side of the enzyme coordinate metal binding.<ref name="Wu 2001" />

[[File:Protoporphyrin IX with letters.svg|right|thumb|Protoporphyrin IX with pyrrole rings lettered.]]
The mechanism of human protoporphyrin metalation remains under investigation. Many researchers have hypothesized distortion of the porphyrin macrocycle as key to catalysis. Researchers studying ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' ferrochelatase propose a mechanism for iron insertion into protoporphyrin in which the enzyme tightly grips rings B, C, and D while bending ring A 36<sup>o</sup>. Normally planar, this distortion exposes the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen in ring A to the Fe<sup>+2</sup> ion.<ref name="Lecerof 2000">{{cite journal|last1=Lecerof|first1=D.|last2=Fodje|first2=M.|last3=Hansson|first3=A.|last4=Hansson|first4=M.|last5=Al-Karadaghi|first5=S.|title=Structural and mechanistic basis of porphyrin metallation by ferrochelatase|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|date=March 2000|volume=297|issue=1|pages=221–232|doi=10.1006/jmbi.2000.3569|pmid=10704318}}</ref> Subsequent investigation revealed a 100<sup>o</sup> distortion in protoporphyrin bound to human ferrochelatase.

{{Infobox titanium}}
'''Titanium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Ti''' and [[atomic number]] 22. It is a lustrous [[transition metal]] with a silver color, low density, and high strength. Titanium is resistant to [[corrosion]] in [[sea water]], [[aqua regia]], and [[chlorine]].

Titanium was discovered in [[Cornwall]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], by [[William Gregor]] in 1791, and was named by [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]] after the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] of [[Greek mythology]]. The element occurs within a number of [[mineral]] deposits, principally [[rutile]] and [[ilmenite]], which are widely distributed in the [[Earth's crust]] and [[lithosphere]], and it is found in almost all living things, water bodies, rocks, and soils.<ref name="EBC"/> The metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores by the [[Kroll process|Kroll]]<ref name="LANL"/> and [[Hunter process]]es. The most common compound, [[titanium dioxide]], is a popular [[photocatalysis|photocatalyst]] and is used in the manufacture of white pigments.<ref name="HistoryAndUse">{{cite book|last=Krebs|first=Robert E.|title=The History and Use of Our Earth's Chemical Elements: A Reference Guide|edition=2nd|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=[[Westport, CT]]|isbn=0-313-33438-2|date=2006}}</ref> Other compounds include [[titanium tetrachloride]] (TiCl<sub>4</sub>), a component of [[smoke screen]]s and [[catalyst]]s; and [[Titanium(III) chloride|titanium trichloride]] (TiCl<sub>3</sub>), which is used as a catalyst in the production of [[polypropylene]].<ref name="EBC"/>

Titanium can be [[alloy]]ed with [[iron]], [[aluminium]], [[vanadium]], and [[molybdenum]], among other elements, to produce strong, lightweight alloys for aerospace ([[jet engine]]s, [[missile]]s, and [[spacecraft]]), military, industrial processes (chemicals and petrochemicals, [[desalination plant]]s, pulp, and paper), automotive, agri-food, medical [[prostheses]], orthopedic [[implant (medicine)|implants]], dental and endodontic instruments and files, [[dental implant]]s, sporting goods, jewelry, [[mobile phone]]s, and other applications.<ref name="EBC"/>

The two most useful properties of the metal are corrosion resistance and strength-to-density ratio, the highest of any metallic element.<ref>{{harvnb|Donachie|1988|p=11}}</ref> In its unalloyed condition, titanium is as strong as some [[steel]]s, but less dense.<ref name="Barksdale1968p738">{{harvnb|Barksdale|1968|p=738}}</ref> There are two [[allotropy|allotropic]] forms<ref name="TICE6th">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Titanium |encyclopedia=[[Columbia Encyclopedia]] |edition=6th |date=2000–2006 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |url=http://www.answers.com/Titanium |location=New York |isbn=0-7876-5015-3 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118151229/http://www.answers.com/Titanium |archivedate=18 November 2011 |df=}}</ref> and five naturally occurring [[isotope]]s of this element, <sup>46</sup>Ti through <sup>50</sup>Ti, with <sup>48</sup>Ti being the most [[natural abundance|abundant]] (73.8%).<ref name="EnvChem">{{cite web|url=http://environmentalchemistry.com/yogi/periodic/Ti-pg2.html#Nuclides|title=Periodic Table of Elements: Ti – Titanium|accessdate=26 December 2006|author=Barbalace, Kenneth L.|date=2006}}</ref> Although they have the same number of [[valence electron]]s and are in the same [[group (periodic table)|group]] in the [[periodic table]], titanium and [[zirconium]] differ in many chemical and physical properties.

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===
As a [[metal]], titanium is recognized for its high [[strength-to-weight ratio]].<ref name="TICE6th"/> It is a strong metal with low [[density]] that is quite [[ductility|ductile]] (especially in an [[oxygen]]-free environment),<ref name="EBC">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Titanium|date=2006|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9072643/titanium|accessdate=29 December 2006}}</ref> lustrous, and metallic-white in [[color]].<ref name="Stwertka1998"/> The relatively high melting point (more than 1,650&nbsp;°C or 3,000&nbsp;°F) makes it useful as a [[refractory metals|refractory metal]]. It is [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] and has fairly low [[electrical conductivity|electrical]] and [[thermal conductivity]].<ref name="EBC"/>

Commercially pure (99.2% pure) [[titanium alloy#Grades_of_titanium|grades]] of titanium have [[ultimate tensile strength]] of about 434 [[megapascal|MPa]] (63,000 [[pounds per square inch|psi]]), equal to that of common, low-grade steel alloys, but are less dense. Titanium is 60% denser than aluminium, but more than twice as strong<ref name="Barksdale1968p738"/> as the most commonly used [[6061 aluminium alloy|6061-T6 aluminium alloy]]. Certain titanium alloys (e.g., [[Titanium Beta C|Beta C]]) achieve tensile strengths of over 1,400 MPa (20,0000 psi).<ref>{{harvnb|Donachie|1988|loc=Appendix J, Table J.2}}</ref> However, titanium loses strength when heated above {{convert|430|°C|°F}}.<ref name="Barksdale1968p734">{{harvnb|Barksdale|1968|p=734}}</ref>

Titanium is not as hard as some grades of heat-treated steel; it is non-magnetic and a poor conductor of heat and electricity. Machining requires precautions, because the material can [[galling|gall]] unless sharp tools and proper cooling methods are used. Like steel structures, those made from titanium have a [[fatigue limit]] that guarantees longevity in some applications.<ref name="Stwertka1998"/>

The metal is a dimorphic [[allotropy|allotrope]] of an hexagonal α form that changes into a body-centered cubic (lattice) β form at {{convert|882|°C|°F}}.<ref name="Barksdale1968p734"/> The [[specific heat capacity|specific heat]] of the α form increases dramatically as it is heated to this transition temperature but then falls and remains fairly constant for the β form regardless of temperature.<ref name="Barksdale1968p734"/>

===Chemical properties===
[[File:Titanium in water porbiax diagram.png|thumb|left|The [[Pourbaix diagram]] for titanium in pure water, perchloric acid, or sodium hydroxide<ref name="medusa">Puigdomenech, Ignasi (2004) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130605034847/http://www.kth.se/che/medusa ''Hydra/Medusa Chemical Equilibrium Database and Plotting Software''], KTH Royal Institute of Technology.</ref>]]
Like [[aluminium]] and [[magnesium]], titanium metal and its alloys [[oxidize]] immediately upon exposure to air. Titanium readily reacts with oxygen at {{convert|1200|°C|°F}} in air, and at {{convert|610|°C|°F}} in pure oxygen, forming [[titanium dioxide]].<ref name="TICE6th"/> It is, however, slow to react with water and air at ambient temperatures because it forms a [[Passivation (chemistry)|passive]] oxide coating that protects the bulk metal from further oxidation.<ref name="EBC"/> When it first forms, this protective layer is only 1–2 [[nanometre|nm]] thick but continues to grow slowly; reaching a thickness of 25&nbsp;nm in four years.<ref name="Emsley2001p453"/>

Atmospheric passivation gives titanium excellent resistance to corrosion, almost equivalent to [[platinum]]. Titanium is capable of withstanding attack by dilute [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] and [[hydrochloric acid]]s, chloride solutions, and most organic acids.<ref name="LANL"/> However, titanium is corroded by concentrated acids.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Pitting Corrosion of Titanium|journal=J. Electrochem. Soc.|volume=141|issue=3|pages=636–642|date=1994|author=Casillas, N.|author2=Charlebois, S.|author3=Smyrl, W. H.|author4=White, H. S.|doi=10.1149/1.2054783}}</ref> As indicated by its negative redox potential, titanium is thermodynamically a very reactive metal that burns in normal atmosphere at lower temperatures than the melting point. Melting is possible only in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum. At {{convert|550|°C|°F}}, it combines with chlorine.<ref name="LANL"/> It also reacts with the other halogens and absorbs hydrogen.<ref name="HistoryAndUse"/>

Titanium is one of the few elements that burns in pure nitrogen gas, reacting at {{convert|800|°C|°F}} to form [[titanium nitride]], which causes embrittlement.<ref name="titaniumindustry">{{cite book|title=Industrial Applications of Titanium and Zirconium|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0Adr4zleybgC&pg=PA112|page= 112|first= A. L.|last= Forrest |chapter= Effects of Metal Chemistry on Behavior of Titanium in Industrial Applications|date=1981}}</ref> Because of its high reactivity with oxygen, nitrogen, and some other gases, titanium [[electrical filament|filaments]] are applied in [[titanium sublimation pump]]s as scavengers for these gases. Such pumps inexpensively and reliably produce extremely low pressures in [[ultra-high vacuum]] systems.

It is present as oxides in most [[igneous rock]]s, in [[sedimentary rock|sediments]] derived from them, in living things, and natural bodies of water.<ref name="EBC"/><ref name="LANL">{{RubberBible86th}}</ref> Of the 801 types of igneous rocks analyzed by the [[United States Geological Survey]], 784 contained titanium. Its proportion in soils is approximately 0.5 to 1.5%.<ref name="Barksdale1968p732"/>

Common titanium-containing [[mineral]]s are [[anatase]], [[brookite]], [[ilmenite]], [[perovskite]], [[rutile]], and [[titanite]] (sphene).<ref name="Emsley2001p453">{{harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=453}}</ref> [[Akaogiite]] is an extremely rare mineral consisting of titanium dioxide. Of these minerals, only rutile and ilmenite have economic importance, yet even they are difficult to find in high concentrations. About 6.0 and 0.7 million tonnes of those minerals were mined in 2011, respectively.<ref name=USGS/> Significant titanium-bearing ilmenite deposits exist in western [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Mozambique]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[South Africa]], and [[Ukraine]].<ref name="Emsley2001p453"/> About 186,000 tonnes of titanium [[metal sponge]] were produced in 2011, mostly in China (60,000 t), Japan (56,000 t), Russia (40,000 t), United States (32,000 t) and Kazakhstan (20,700 t). Total reserves of titanium are estimated to exceed 600 million tonnes.<ref name=USGS/>

The concentration of titanium is about 4 picomolar in the ocean. At 100&nbsp;°C, the concentration of titanium in water is estimated to be less than 10<sup>−7</sup> M at pH 7. The identity of titanium species in aqueous solution remains unknown because of its low solubility and the lack of sensitive spectroscopic methods, although only the 4+ oxidation state is stable in air. No evidence exists for a biological role, although rare organisms are known to accumulate high concentrations of titanium.<ref>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1021/cr1002886 |pmid= 22074443 |title= Bioinorganic Chemistry of Titanium |journal= Chemical Reviews |volume= 112 |issue= 3 |pages= 1863 |year= 2012 |last1= Buettner |first1= K.

Titanium is contained in [[meteorite]]s, and it has been detected in the [[Sun]] and in [[stellar classification|M-type]] [[star]]s<ref name="LANL"/> (the coolest type) with a surface temperature of {{convert|3200|°C|°F}}.<ref name="Emsley2001p451">{{harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=451}}</ref> [[Rock (geology)|Rocks]] brought back from the [[Moon]] during the [[Apollo 17]] mission are composed of 12.1% TiO<sub>2</sub>.<ref name="LANL"/> It is also found in [[coal]] ash, [[plant]]s, and even the [[human]] body.

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of titanium}}
Naturally occurring titanium is composed of 5 stable [[isotope]]s: <sup>46</sup>Ti, <sup>47</sup>Ti, <sup>48</sup>Ti, <sup>49</sup>Ti, and <sup>50</sup>Ti, with <sup>48</sup>Ti being the most abundant (73.8% [[natural abundance]]). Eleven [[radioisotope]]s have been characterized, the most stable being <sup>44</sup>Ti with a [[half-life]] of 63 years; <sup>45</sup>Ti, 184.8 minutes; <sup>51</sup>Ti, 5.76 minutes; and <sup>52</sup>Ti, 1.7 minutes. All the other [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives less than 33 seconds and the majority, less than half a second.<ref name="EnvChem"/>

The isotopes of titanium range in [[atomic weight]] from 39.99 [[unified atomic mass unit|u]] (<sup>40</sup>Ti) to 57.966 u (<sup>58</sup>Ti). The primary [[decay mode]] before the most abundant stable isotope, <sup>48</sup>Ti, is [[electron capture]] and the primary mode after is [[beta emission]]. The primary [[decay product]]s before <sup>48</sup>Ti are element 21 ([[scandium]]) isotopes and the primary products after are element 23 ([[vanadium]]) isotopes.<ref name="EnvChem"/>

Titanium becomes radioactive upon bombardment with [[deuterons]], emitting mainly [[positrons]] and hard [[gamma rays]].<ref name="LANL"/>

[[File:Titanium nitride coating.jpg|thumb|left|50px|alt=A steel colored twist drill bit with the spiral groove colored in a golden shade.|TiN-coated [[drill]] bit]]
The +4 [[oxidation state]] dominates titanium chemistry,<ref name="Greenwood1997p958">{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=958}}</ref> but compounds in the +3 [[oxidation state]] are also common.<ref name="Greenwood1997p970">{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=970}}</ref> Commonly, titanium adopts an [[octahedral coordination geometry]] in its complexes, but tetrahedral TiCl<sub>4</sub> is a notable exception. Because of its high oxidation state, titanium(IV) compounds exhibit a high degree of [[covalent bond]]ing. Unlike most other transition metals, simple [[transition metal aquo complex|aquo Ti(IV) complex]]es are unknown.

===Oxides, sulfides, and alkoxides===
The most important oxide is TiO<sub>2</sub>, which exists in three important [[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]]; [[anatase]], [[brookite]], and [[rutile]]. All of these are white diamagnetic solids, although mineral samples can appear dark (see [[rutile]]). They adopt polymeric structures in which Ti is surrounded by six [[oxide]] ligands that link to other Ti centers.

The term ''[[titanate]]s'' usually refers to titanium(IV) compounds, as represented by [[barium titanate]] (BaTiO<sub>3</sub>). With a [[perovskite]] structure, this material exhibits [[piezoelectric]] properties and is used as a transducer in the interconversion of [[sound]] and [[electricity]].<ref name="TICE6th"/> Many minerals are titanates, e.g. [[ilmenite]] (FeTiO<sub>3</sub>). [[Star sapphire (jewel)|Star sapphires]] and [[ruby|rubies]] get their [[asterism (gemmology)|asterism]] (star-forming shine) from the presence of titanium dioxide impurities.<ref name="Emsley2001p453"/>

A variety of reduced oxides of titanium are known. Ti<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, described as a Ti(IV)-Ti(III) species, is a purple semiconductor produced by reduction of TiO<sub>2</sub> with hydrogen at high temperatures,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Gang|last2=Huang|first2=Wan-Xia|last3=Yi|first3=Yong|title=Preparation and Optical Storage Properties of λTi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5</sub> Powder|journal=Journal of Inorganic Materials|date=26 June 2013|volume=28|issue=4|pages=425–430|doi=10.3724/SP.J.1077.2013.12309|language=Chinese}}</ref> and is used industrially when surfaces need to be vapour-coated with titanium dioxide: it evaporates as pure TiO, whereas TiO<sub>2</sub> evaporates as a mixture of oxides and deposits coatings with variable refractive index.<ref>{{cite journal|arxiv=1406.0622|last1=Bonardi|first1=Antonio|title=A new solution for mirror coating in $γ$-ray Cherenkov Astronomy|journal=Experimental Astronomy|volume=38|pages=1|last2=Pühlhofer|first2=Gerd|last3=Hermanutz|first3=Stephan|last4=Santangelo|first4=Andrea|date=2014|doi=10.1007/s10686-014-9398-x|bibcode=2014ExA....38....1B}}</ref> Also known is [[titanium(III) oxide|Ti<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>]], with the [[corundum]] structure, and [[titanium(II) oxide|TiO]], with the rock salt structure, although often nonstoichiometric.<ref>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd|page=962}}</ref>

The [[alkoxide]]s of titanium(IV), prepared by reacting TiCl<sub>4</sub> with alcohols, are colourless compounds that convert to the dioxide on reaction with water. They are industrially useful for depositing solid TiO<sub>2</sub> via the [[sol-gel process]]. [[Titanium isopropoxide]] is used in the synthesis of chiral organic compounds via the [[Sharpless epoxidation]].

Titanium forms a variety of sulfides, but only [[titanium disulfide|TiS<sub>2</sub>]] has attracted significant interest. It adopts a layered structure and was used as a cathode in the development of [[lithium batteries]]. Because Ti(IV) is a [[HSAB theory|"hard cation"]], the sulfides of titanium are unstable and tend to hydrolyze to the oxide with release of hydrogen sulfide.

===Nitrides and carbides===
[[Titanium nitride]] (TiN) is a member of a family of refractory transition metal nitrides and exhibits properties similar to both covalent compounds including; thermodynamic stability, extreme hardness, thermal/electrical conductivity, and a high melting point.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Saha|first=Naresh|date=|year=1992|title=Titanium nitride oxidation chemistry: An x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study.|url=http://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.351465|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=no. 7|pages=3072-3079|via=}}</ref> TiN has a hardness equivalent to [[sapphire]] and [[carborundum]] (9.0 on the [[Mohs Scale]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpi.edu/~schubert/Educational-resources/Materials-Hardness.pdf |title=The hardness scale introduced by Friederich Mohs |author=Schubert, E.F. |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603075632/http://www.rpi.edu/~schubert/Educational-resources/Materials-Hardness.pdf |archivedate=3 June 2010 |df=}}</ref> and is often used to coat cutting tools, such as [[drill bit]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Truini|first=Joseph|title=Drill Bits|journal=Popular Mechanics|publisher=Hearst Magazines|volume=165|date=May 1988|issue=5|page=91|issn=0032-4558|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z-QDAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover}}</ref> It is also used as a gold-colored decorative finish and as a [[Copper-based chips#Barrier metal|barrier metal]] in [[semiconductor fabrication]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Baliga|first=B.

Titanium(III) and titanium(II) also form stable chlorides. A notable example is [[titanium(III) chloride]] (TiCl<sub>3</sub>), which is used as a [[catalyst]] for production of [[polyolefin]]s (see [[Ziegler-Natta catalyst]]) and a reducing [[reagent|agent]] in organic chemistry.

===Organometallic complexes===
{{Main|Organotitanium chemistry}}
Owing to the important role of titanium compounds as [[polymerization]] catalyst, compounds with Ti-C bonds have been intensively studied. The most common organotitanium complex is [[titanocene dichloride]] ((C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>TiCl<sub>2</sub>). Related compounds include [[Tebbe's reagent]] and [[Petasis reagent]]. Titanium forms [[metal carbonyl|carbonyl complexes]], e.g. [[titanocene dicarbonyl|(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Ti(CO)<sub>2</sub>]].<ref>[[John F. Hartwig|Hartwig, J.

Around the same time, [[Franz-Joseph Müller von Reichenstein]] produced a similar substance, but could not identify it.<ref name="HistoryAndUse"/> The oxide was independently rediscovered in 1795 by [[Prussia]]n chemist [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]] in rutile from Boinik (German name of Bajmócska) village of Hungary (now Bojničky in Slovakia).<ref name="Emsley2001p452"/><ref>Klaproth, Martin Heinrich (1795) [https://books.google.com/books?id=5zFGAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA233#v=onepage&q&f=false "Chemische Untersuchung des sogenannten hungarischen rothen Schörls"] (Chemical investigation of the so-called Hungarian red tourmaline [rutile]) in: ''Beiträge zur chemischen Kenntniss der Mineralkörper'' (Contributions to the chemical knowledge of mineral substances), vol. 1, (Berlin, (Germany): Heinrich August Rottmann, 233–244.

In addition to the ASTM specifications, titanium alloys are also produced to meet aerospace and military specifications (SAE-AMS, MIL-T), ISO standards, and country-specific specifications, as well as proprietary end-user specifications for aerospace, military, medical, and industrial applications.<ref>{{harvnb|Donachie|1988|pp=13–16, Appendices H and J}}</ref>

Titanium powder is manufactured using a [[flow production]] process known as the [[Armstrong process]]<ref name="Roza2008p25">{{harvnb|Roza|2008|p=25}}</ref> that is similar to the batch production Hunter process. A stream of titanium tetrachloride gas is added to a stream of [[molten]] sodium metal; the products (sodium chloride [[salt]] and titanium particles) is filtered from the extra sodium. Titanium is then separated from the salt by water washing. Both sodium and chlorine are recycled to produce and process more titanium tetrachloride.<ref name="ECI online">{{cite web|title=Titanium|url=http://www.essentialchemicalindustry.org/metals/titanium.html|website=The Essential Chemical Industry online|publisher=CIEC Promoting Science at the University of York|location=York, UK|date=15 January 2015}}</ref>

All [[welding]] of titanium must be done in an inert atmosphere of [[argon]] or [[helium]] to shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases (oxygen, [[nitrogen]], and [[hydrogen]]).<ref name="Barksdale1968p734"/> Contamination causes a variety of conditions, such as [[embrittlement]], which reduce the integrity of the assembly welds and lead to joint failure.

Commercially pure flat product (sheet, plate) can be formed readily, but processing must take into account the fact that the metal has a "memory" and tends to spring back.

Titanium alloys are used in spectacle frames that are rather expensive but highly durable, long lasting, light weight, and cause no skin allergies. Many backpackers use titanium equipment, including cookware, eating utensils, lanterns, and tent stakes. Though slightly more expensive than traditional steel or aluminium alternatives, titanium products can be significantly lighter without compromising strength.

Because of titanium's superior strength and light weight relative to other metals (steel, stainless steel, and aluminium), and because of recent advances in metalworking techniques, its use has become more widespread in the manufacture of firearms. Primary uses include pistol frames and revolver cylinders. For the same reasons, it is used in the body of laptop computers (for example, in [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s PowerBook line).<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=8 August 2009|url=http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook_g4/stats/powerbook_g4_400.html|title=Apple PowerBook G4 400 (Original – Ti) Specs|work=everymac.com}}</ref>

===Jewelry===
[[File:Anodized titanium table.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Relation between voltage and color for anodized titanium. (Cateb, 2010).]]
Because of its durability, titanium has become more popular for designer jewelry (particularly, [[titanium ring]]s).<ref name="Donachie2000"/> Its inertness makes it a good choice for those with allergies or those who will be wearing the jewelry in environments such as swimming pools. Titanium is also [[Titanium gold|alloyed with gold]] to produce an alloy that can be marketed as [[carat (purity)|24-carat]] gold because the 1% of alloyed Ti is insufficient to require a lesser mark.

===Medical===
{{Main|Titanium biocompatibility}}
Because titanium is [[biocompatibility|biocompatible]] (non-toxic and not rejected by the body), it has many medical uses, including surgical implements and implants, such as hip balls and sockets ([[joint replacement]]) and [[dental implant]]s that can stay in place for up to 20 years.<ref name="Emsley2001p452">{{harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=452}}</ref> The titanium is often alloyed with about 4% aluminium or 6% Al and 4% vanadium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.totaljoints.info/orthopaedic_metal_alloys.htm|title=Orthopaedic Metal Alloys|publisher=Totaljoints.info|accessdate=27 September 2010}}</ref>
[[File:Titanium plaatje voor pols.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Medical screws and plate used for repair fracture of the wrist, scale is in centimeters.]]
Titanium has the inherent ability to [[osseointegration|osseointegrate]], enabling use in [[dental implants]] that can last for over 30 years. This property is also useful for [[internal fixator|orthopedic implant]] applications.<ref name="Emsley2001p452"/> These benefit from titanium's lower modulus of elasticity ([[Young's modulus]]) to more closely match that of the bone that such devices are intended to repair. As a result, skeletal loads are more evenly shared between bone and implant, leading to a lower incidence of bone degradation due to stress shielding and [[periprosthetic]] bone fractures, which occur at the boundaries of orthopedic implants. However, titanium alloys' stiffness is still more than twice that of bone, so adjacent bone bears a greatly reduced load and may deteriorate.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2010/09/titanium-foams-replace-injured-bones.jsp|title=Titanium foams replace injured bones|journal=Research News |date=1 September 2010|publisher=Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft|accessdate=27 September 2010}}</ref><ref>Lavine, Marc S., ''[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6372/173.6?utm_campaign=ec_sci_2018-01-11&et_rid=374427768&et_cid=1784931 Make no bones about titanium]'',

As a powder or in the form of metal shavings, titanium metal poses a significant fire hazard and, when heated in [[air]], an explosion hazard.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cotell |first=Catherine Mary |author2=Sprague, J.

This poses a limitation to its use in liquid oxygen systems, such as those in the aerospace industry. Because titanium tubing impurities can cause fires when exposed to oxygen, titanium is prohibited in gaseous oxygen respiration systems. Steel tubing is used for high pressure systems (3,000 p.s.i.) and aluminium tubing for low pressure systems.

'''Tritium''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|ɪ|t|i|ə|m}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|ɪ|ʃ|i|ə|m}}; symbol {{Element2|tritium}} or {{SimpleNuclide|hydrogen|3}}, also known as '''hydrogen-3''') is a [[radioactivity|radioactive]] [[isotopes of hydrogen|isotope of hydrogen]]. The [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of tritium (sometimes called a '''triton''') contains one [[proton]] and two [[neutron]]s, whereas the nucleus of [[hydrogen-1|protium]] (by far the most abundant hydrogen isotope) contains one proton and no neutrons. Naturally occurring tritium is extremely rare on Earth, where trace amounts are formed by the interaction of the atmosphere with [[cosmic ray]]s. It can be produced by irradiating [[lithium]] metal or lithium-bearing ceramic pebbles in a [[nuclear reactor]].  Tritium is used as a [[radioactive tracer]], in [[radioluminescence|radioluminescent]] light sources for watches and instruments, and, along with [[deuterium]], as a fuel for nuclear fusion reactions with applications in energy generation and weapons. The name of this isotope is derived {{ety|gre|''τρίτος'' (trítos)|third}}. 

==Decay==
While tritium has several different experimentally determined values of its [[half-life]], the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] lists {{nowrap|4,500 ± 8 days}} ({{nowrap|12.32 ± 0.02 years}}).<ref>

and it releases 18.6&nbsp;[[keV]] of energy in the process. The [[electron]]'s kinetic energy varies, with an average of 5.7&nbsp;keV, while the remaining energy is carried off by the nearly undetectable [[electron antineutrino]]. [[Beta particles]] from tritium can penetrate only about 6.0&nbsp;mm of air, and they are incapable of passing through the dead outermost layer of human skin.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130520184942/http://www.ehso.emory.edu/content-forms/3anuclidedatasafetysheets.pdf Nuclide safety data sheet: Hydrogen-3]. ehso.emory.edu</ref> The unusually low energy released in the tritium beta decay makes the decay (along with that of [[Isotopes of rhenium|rhenium-187]]) appropriate for absolute neutrino mass measurements in the laboratory (the most recent experiment being [[KATRIN]]).

The low energy of tritium's radiation makes it difficult to detect tritium-labeled compounds except by using [[liquid scintillation counting]].

==Production==

===Lithium===
Tritium is produced in [[Nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactors]] by [[neutron activation]] of [[lithium-6]]. This is possible with neutrons of any energy, and is an [[exothermic]] reaction yielding 4.8&nbsp;MeV. In comparison, the [[D-T fusion|fusion of deuterium with tritium]] releases about 17.6&nbsp;MeV of energy. For applications in proposed fusion energy reactors, such as [[ITER]], pebbles consisting of lithium bearing ceramics including Li<sub>2</sub>TiO<sub>3</sub> and Li<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, are being developed for tritium breeding within a helium cooled pebble bed (HCPB), also known as a breeder blanket.

High-energy neutrons can also produce tritium from [[lithium-7]] in an [[endothermic]] (a net heat consuming reaction) reaction, consuming 2.466&nbsp;MeV. This was discovered when the 1954 [[Castle Bravo#Cause of high yield|Castle Bravo]] nuclear test produced an unexpectedly high yield.<ref name=ieer>

===Deuterium===
{{See also|Heavy water#Tritium production}}
Tritium is also produced in [[heavy water-moderated reactor]]s whenever a [[deuterium]] nucleus captures a neutron. This reaction has a quite small absorption [[cross section (physics)|cross section]], making [[heavy water]] a good [[neutron moderator]], and relatively little tritium is produced. Even so, cleaning tritium from the moderator may be desirable after several years to reduce the risk of its escaping to the environment. [[Ontario Power Generation]]'s "Tritium Removal Facility" processes up to {{convert|2500|t}} of heavy water a year, and it separates out about {{convert|2.5|kg|abbr=on}} of tritium, making it available for other uses.<ref>{{cite web

Deuterium's absorption cross section for [[thermal neutron]]s is about 0.52 [[barn (unit)|millibarn]]s, whereas that of [[oxygen-16]] ({{nuclide|oxygen|16}}) is about 0.19 millibarns and that of [[oxygen-17]] ({{nuclide|oxygen|17}}) is about 240 millibarns.

===Fission===
Tritium is an uncommon product of the [[nuclear fission]] of [[uranium-235]], [[plutonium-239]], and [[uranium-233]], with a production of about one atom per each 10,000 fissions.<ref name=anl>{{cite web

===Helium-3===
Tritium's [[decay product]] [[helium-3]] has a very large cross section for reacting with [[thermal neutrons]], expelling a proton, hence it is rapidly converted back to tritium in [[nuclear reactor]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/8.13/www/tgm-neutron-detectors.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041121073851/http://web.mit.edu/8.13/www/tgm-neutron-detectors.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 November 2004|title=Helium-3 Neutron Proportional Counters|work=mit.edu|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Worldwide, the production of tritium from natural sources is 148,000&nbsp;[[terabecquerel]]s per year. The global equilibrium inventory of tritium created by natural sources remains approximately constant at 2,590,000&nbsp;terabecquerels. This is due to a fixed production rate and losses proportional to the inventory.<ref>{{cite web|title=Radiation Information Network's Tritium Information Section|url=http://www.physics.isu.edu/radinf/tritium.htm|publisher=Idaho State University}}</ref>

===Production history===
According to the [[Institute for Energy and Environmental Research]] report in 1996 about the [[U.S. Department of Energy]], only {{convert|225|kg|abbr=on}} of tritium has been produced in the United States since 1955. Since it continually decays into helium-3, the total amount remaining was about {{convert|75|kg|abbr=on}} at the time of the report.<ref name=ieer/><ref>[http://www.ieer.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2012/05/Tritium_1996_Zerriffi.pdf Full text of IEER 1996 report]. ieer.org</ref>

Tritium for American [[nuclear weapon]]s was produced in special [[heavy water reactor]]s at the [[Savannah River Site]] until their closures in 1988. With the [[START I|Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty]] (START) after the end of the [[Cold War]], the existing supplies were sufficient for the new, smaller number of nuclear weapons for some time.

The production of tritium was resumed with [[irradiation]] of rods containing [[lithium]] (replacing the usual [[control rod]]s containing [[boron]], [[cadmium]], or [[hafnium]]), at the reactors of the commercial [[Watts Bar Nuclear Generating Station]] in 2003–2005 followed by extraction of tritium from the rods at the new Tritium Extraction Facility<ref>[http://www.srs.gov/general/programs/dp/index.htm Defense Programs]. Srs.gov. Retrieved on 2013-03-20.</ref> at the Savannah River Site beginning in November 2006.<ref>{{cite web

==Properties==
Tritium has an [[atomic mass]] of 3.0160492&nbsp;[[Unified atomic mass unit|u]]. Diatomic tritium ({{Element2|Tritium}}<sub>2</sub> or {{SimpleNuclide|Hydrogen|3}}<sub>2</sub>) is a gas at [[standard temperature and pressure]]. Combined with [[oxygen]], it forms a liquid called [[tritiated water]] ({{Element2|Tritium}}<sub>2</sub>{{Element2|link=yes|Oxygen}}).

Tritium's [[specific activity]] is {{convert|9650|Ci/g|Bq/g|lk=on}}.<ref>[http://www.oseh.umich.edu/radiation/h3.shtml OSEH: Radionuclide Safety Data Sheets – H-3]. Oseh.umich.edu. Retrieved on 2013-03-20.</ref>

Tritium figures prominently in studies of [[nuclear fusion]] because of its favorable reaction [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]] and the large amount of energy (17.6&nbsp;MeV) produced through its reaction with deuterium:

<!-- Autogenerated using Phykiformulae 0.11 by [[User:SkyLined]]
T + D -> He + n
-->:{| border="0"
|- style="height:2em;"
|{{nuclide|Tritium}}&nbsp;||+&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|Deuterium}}&nbsp;||→&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|helium|4}}&nbsp;||+&nbsp;||{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Neutron}}
|}

All atomic nuclei, being composed of protons and neutrons, repel one another because of their positive charge. However, if the atoms have a high enough temperature and pressure (for example, in the core of the Sun), then their random motions can overcome such electrical repulsion (called the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]]), and they can come close enough for the [[strong nuclear force]] to take effect, fusing them into heavier atoms.

The tritium nucleus, containing one proton and two neutrons,<ref name=anl/> has the same charge as the nucleus of ordinary hydrogen, and it experiences the same electrostatic repulsive force when brought close to another atomic nucleus. However, the neutrons in the tritium nucleus increase the attractive strong nuclear force when brought close enough to another atomic nucleus. As a result, tritium can more easily fuse with other light atoms, compared with the ability of ordinary hydrogen to do so.

The same is true, albeit to a lesser extent, of deuterium. This is why [[brown dwarf]]s (so-called failed [[star]]s) cannot utilize ordinary hydrogen, but they do fuse the small minority of deuterium nuclei.

[[File:Gaseous tritium light source.jpg|thumb|right|[[Radioluminescent]] {{convert|1.8|Ci|GBq|lk=on}} {{convert|6|x|0.2|in|mm}} tritium vials are thin, tritium-gas-filled glass vials whose inner surfaces are coated with a [[phosphor]]. The vial shown here is brand-new.]]

Like the other isotopes of [[hydrogen]], tritium is difficult to confine. Rubber, plastic, and some kinds of steel are all somewhat permeable. This has raised concerns that if tritium were used in large quantities, in particular for [[fusion reactor]]s, it may contribute to [[radioactive contamination]], although its short half-life should prevent significant long-term accumulation in the atmosphere.

The high levels of atmospheric [[nuclear weapons testing]] that took place prior to the enactment of the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] proved to be unexpectedly useful to oceanographers. The high levels of tritium oxide introduced into upper layers of the oceans have been used in the years since then to measure the rate of mixing of the upper layers of the oceans with their lower levels.

==Health risks==
Tritium is an isotope of hydrogen, which allows it to readily bind to [[hydroxyl radical]]s, forming [[tritiated water]] ([[hydrogen-1|H]]T[[Oxygen|O]]), and to carbon atoms. Since tritium is a low energy [[beta particle|beta emitter]], it is not dangerous externally (its beta particles are unable to penetrate the skin),<ref>[http://www.physics.isu.edu/radinf/tritium.htm Tritium Information Section]. physics.isu.edu</ref> but it can be a radiation hazard when inhaled, ingested via food or water, or absorbed through the skin.<ref>[http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/canada/en/documents-and-links/publications/tritium-hazard-report-pollu.pdf Tritium Hazard Report: Pollution and Radiation Risk from Canadian Nuclear Facilities], I.

The beta particles emitted by the radioactive decay of small amounts of tritium cause chemicals called [[phosphor]]s to glow.  This [[radioluminescence]] is used in [[self-powered lighting]] devices called [[betalight]]s, which are used for night illumination of firearm sights, [[watches]], [[exit sign]]s, map lights, knives and a variety of other devices.  Tritium has replaced [[radioluminescent paint]] containing [[radium]] in this application, which can cause [[bone cancer]] and has been banned in most countries for decades.

===Nuclear weapons===
Tritium is an important component in nuclear weapons. It is used to enhance the efficiency and yield of [[fission bomb]]s and the fission stages of [[hydrogen bomb]]s in a process known as "[[boosted fission weapon|boosting]]" as well as in [[external neutron initiator]]s for such weapons.

====Neutron initiator====
These are devices incorporated in [[nuclear weapon]]s which produce a pulse of neutrons when the bomb is detonated to initiate the [[fission reaction]] in the fissionable core (pit) of the bomb, after it is compressed to a [[critical mass]] by explosives.  Actuated by an ultrafast switch like a [[krytron]], a small [[particle accelerator]] drives [[ions]] of tritium and deuterium to energies above the 15&nbsp;[[keV]] or so needed for deuterium-tritium fusion and directs them into a metal target where the tritium and deuterium are [[adsorbed]] as [[hydride]]s. High-energy [[fusion neutron]]s from the resulting fusion radiate in all directions. Some of these strike plutonium or uranium nuclei in the primary's pit, initiating [[nuclear chain reaction]]. The quantity of neutrons produced is large in absolute numbers, allowing the pit to quickly achieve neutron levels that would otherwise need many more generations of chain reaction, though still small compared to the total number of nuclei in the pit.

====Boosting====
{{Main article|Boosted fission weapon}}
Before detonation, a few grams of tritium-deuterium gas are injected into the hollow "[[pit (nuclear weapon)|pit]]" of fissile plutonium or uranium. The early stages of the fission chain reaction supply enough heat and compression to start deuterium-tritium fusion, then both fission and fusion proceed in parallel, the fission assisting the fusion by continuing heating and compression, and the fusion assisting the fission with highly energetic (14.1&nbsp;[[MeV]]) neutrons. As the fission fuel depletes and also explodes outward, it falls below the density needed to stay critical by itself, but the fusion neutrons make the fission process progress faster and continue longer than it would without boosting. Increased yield comes overwhelmingly from the increase in fission. The energy released by the fusion itself is much smaller because the amount of fusion fuel is so much smaller. The effects of boosting include:

*increased yield (for the same amount of fission fuel, compared to detonation without boosting)
*the possibility of [[variable yield]] by varying the amount of fusion fuel
*allowing the bomb to require a smaller amount of the very expensive fissile material – and also eliminating the risk of predetonation by nearby nuclear explosions
*not so stringent requirements on the implosion setup, allowing for a smaller and lighter amount of high-explosives to be used

The tritium in a [[warhead]] is continually undergoing radioactive decay, hence becoming unavailable for fusion. Furthermore its [[decay product]], helium-3, absorbs neutrons if exposed to the ones emitted by nuclear fission. This potentially offsets or reverses the intended effect of the tritium, which was to generate many free neutrons, if too much helium-3 has accumulated from the decay of tritium. Therefore, it is necessary to replenish tritium in boosted bombs periodically. The estimated quantity needed is 4&nbsp;grams per warhead.<ref name=ieer/> To maintain constant levels of tritium, about 0.20&nbsp;grams per warhead per year must be supplied to the bomb.

One [[mole (unit)|mole]] of deuterium-tritium gas would contain about 3.0&nbsp;grams of tritium and 2.0&nbsp;grams of deuterium. In comparison, the 20&nbsp;moles of plutonium in a nuclear bomb consists of about 4.5&nbsp;kilograms of [[plutonium-239]].

====Tritium in hydrogen bomb secondaries====
{{see also|Nuclear weapon design}}
Since tritium undergoes radioactive decay, and is also difficult to confine physically, the much larger secondary charge of heavy hydrogen isotopes needed in a true [[hydrogen bomb]] uses solid [[lithium deuteride]] as its source of deuterium and tritium, producing the tritium ''in situ'' during secondary ignition.

During the detonation of the primary [[fission bomb]] stage in a thermonuclear weapon ([[History of the Teller–Ulam design|Teller-Ullam staging]]), the [[Thermonuclear weapon|sparkplug]], a cylinder of [[Uranium-235|U-235]]/[[Plutonium-239|Pu-239]] at the center of the fusion stage(s), begins to fission in a chain reaction, from excess neutrons channeled from the primary.  The neutrons released from the fission of the sparkplug split [[lithium-6]] into tritium and helium-4, while lithium-7 is split into helium-4, tritium, and one neutron. As these reactions occur, the fusion stage is compressed by photons from the primary and fission of the U-238 or U-238/U-235 jacket surrounding the fusion stage. Therefore, the fusion stage breeds its own tritium as the device detonates.  In the extreme heat and pressure of the explosion, some of the tritium is then forced into fusion with deuterium, and that reaction releases even more neutrons.

Since this fusion process requires an extremely high temperature for ignition, and it produces fewer and less energetic neutrons (only fission, deuterium-tritium fusion, and {{nuclide|lithium|7}} splitting are net neutron producers), [[lithium deuteride]] is not used in boosted bombs, but rather for multi-stage hydrogen bombs.

===Controlled nuclear fusion===
Tritium is an important fuel for controlled [[nuclear fusion]] in both [[magnetic fusion energy|magnetic confinement]] and [[inertial confinement fusion]] reactor designs. The experimental fusion reactor [[ITER]] and the [[National Ignition Facility]] (NIF) will use deuterium-tritium fuel. The [[D-T reaction|deuterium-tritium reaction]] is favorable since it has the largest fusion [[cross section (physics)|cross-section]] (about 5.0&nbsp;[[barn (unit)|barns]]) and it reaches this maximum cross-section at the lowest energy (about 65&nbsp;[[electronvolt|keV]] center-of-mass) of any potential fusion fuel.

The [[Tritium Systems Test Assembly (TSTA)]] was a facility at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] dedicated to the development and demonstration of technologies required for fusion-relevant deuterium-tritium processing.

===Analytical chemistry===
Tritium is sometimes used as a [[radiolabel]]. It has the advantage that almost all organic chemicals contain hydrogen, making it easy to find a place to put tritium on the molecule under investigation. It has the disadvantage of producing a comparatively weak signal.

===Electrical power source===
Tritium can be used in a [[betavoltaic device]] to create an [[atomic battery]] to generate [[electricity]].

==Use as an oceanic transient tracer==
Aside from [[chlorofluorocarbons]], tritium can act as a transient tracer and has the ability to "outline" the biological, chemical, and physical paths throughout the world oceans because of its evolving distribution.<ref name="Oceanus">Jenkins, William J. et al, 1996: [http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/viewArticle.do?id=2330 "Transient Tracers Track Ocean Climate Signals"] ''Oceanus'', Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.</ref> Tritium has thus been used as a tool to examine ocean circulation and ventilation and, for such purposes, is usually measured in Tritium Units where 1&nbsp;TU is defined as the ratio of 1 tritium atom to 10<sup>18</sup> hydrogen atoms.<ref name="Oceanus" /> As noted earlier, nuclear weapons testing, primarily in the high-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere, throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s introduced large amounts of tritium into the atmosphere, especially the [[stratosphere]]. Before these nuclear tests, there were only about 3 to 4&nbsp;kilograms of tritium on the Earth's surface; but these amounts rose by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude during the post-test period.<ref name="Oceanus" /> Some sources reported natural background levels were exceeded by approximately 1,000&nbsp;TU in 1963 and 1964 and the isotope is used in the northern hemisphere to estimate the age of groundwater and construct hydrogeologic simulation models.<ref>Maidment, David R., editor. (1993). Handbook of hydrology. New York : McGraw-Hill. p. 6-39. {{ISBN|0-07-039732-5}}.</ref> Recent scientific sources have estimated atmospheric levels at the height of weapons testing to approach 1,000&nbsp;TU and pre-fallout levels of rainwater to be between 5 and 10&nbsp;TU.<ref>Cossairt, J.

===North Atlantic Ocean===
While in the stratosphere (post-test period), the tritium interacted with and oxidized to water molecules and was present in much of the rapidly produced rainfall, making tritium a prognostic tool for studying the evolution and structure of the [[hydrologic cycle]] as well as the ventilation and formation of water masses in the North Atlantic Ocean.<ref name="Oceanus" /> Bomb-tritium data were used from the Transient Tracers in the Ocean (TTO) program in order to quantify the replenishment and overturning rates for deep water located in the North Atlantic.<ref name="Bomb Tritium">{{Cite journal|author=Doney, Scott C.|date=1992|title=Bomb Tritium in the Deep North Atlantic|journal=Oceanography|volume=5|issue=3|pages=169–170|doi=10.5670/oceanog.1992.11}}</ref> Bomb-tritium also enters the deep ocean around the Antarctic.<ref name="Bomb Tritium Antarctic">{{Cite journal|author=Michel, Robert and Peter M. Williams|date=1973|title=Bomb-produced tritium in the Antarctic Ocean|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=20|issue=3|pages=381–384|doi=10.1016/0012-821X(73)90013-7|bibcode=1973E&PSL..20..381M}}</ref> Most of the bomb tritiated water (HTO) throughout the atmosphere can enter the ocean through the following processes: a) precipitation, b) vapor exchange, and c) river runoff – these processes make HTO a great tracer for time-scales up to a few decades.<ref name="Bomb Tritium" /> Using the data from these processes for 1981, the 1&nbsp;TU isosurface lies between 500 and 1,000&nbsp;meters deep in the [[subtropical]] regions and then extends to 1,500–2,000&nbsp;meters south of the [[Gulf Stream]] due to recirculation and ventilation in the upper portion of the Atlantic Ocean.<ref name="Oceanus" /> To the north, the isosurface deepens and reaches the floor of the [[abyssal plain]] which is directly related to the ventilation of the ocean floor over 10 to 20 year time-scales.<ref name="Oceanus" />

Also evident in the Atlantic Ocean is the tritium profile near [[Bermuda]] between the late 1960s and late 1980s. There is a downward propagation of the tritium maximum from the surface (1960s) to 400&nbsp;meters (1980s), which corresponds to a deepening rate of approximately 18&nbsp;meters per year.<ref name="Oceanus" /> There are also tritium increases at 1,500&nbsp;meters depth in the late 1970s and 2,500&nbsp;meters in the middle of the 1980s, both of which correspond to cooling events in the deep water and associated deep water ventilation.<ref name="Oceanus" />

From a study in 1991, the tritium profile was used as a tool for studying the mixing and spreading of newly formed [[North Atlantic Deep Water]] (NADW), corresponding to tritium increases to 4&nbsp;TU.<ref name="Bomb Tritium" /> This NADW tends to spill over sills that divide the [[Norwegian Sea]] from the North Atlantic Ocean and then flows to the west and equatorward in deep boundary currents. This process was explained via the large-scale tritium distribution in the deep North Atlantic between 1981 and 1983.<ref name="Bomb Tritium" /> The sub-polar gyre tends to be freshened (ventilated) by the NADW and is directly related to the high tritium values (>&nbsp;1.5&nbsp;TU). Also evident was the decrease in tritium in the deep western boundary current by a factor of 10 from the [[Labrador Sea]] to the [[Tropics]], which is indicative of loss to ocean interior due to turbulent mixing and recirculation.<ref name="Bomb Tritium" />

===Pacific and Indian Oceans===
In a 1998 study, tritium concentrations in surface seawater and atmospheric water vapor (10&nbsp;meters above the surface) were sampled at the following locations: the [[Sulu Sea]], the [[Fremantle Bay]], the [[Bay of Bengal]], the [[Penang Bay]], and the [[Strait of Malacca]].<ref name="Tritium">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF02349062|title=Tritium concentration in ocean|date=1999|last1=Kakiuchi|first1=H.|last2=Momoshima|first2=N.|last3=Okai|first3=T.|last4=Maeda|first4=Y.|journal=Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry|volume=239|page=523|issue=3}}</ref> Results indicated that the tritium concentration in surface seawater was highest at the Fremantle Bay (approximately 0.40&nbsp;Bq/liter), which could be accredited to the mixing of runoff of freshwater from nearby lands due to large amounts found in coastal waters.<ref name="Tritium" /> Typically, lower concentrations were found between [[35th parallel south|35]] and [[45th parallel south|45 degrees south]] latitude and near the [[equator]]. Results also indicated that (in general) tritium has decreased over the years (up to 1997) due to the physical decay of bomb tritium in the [[Indian Ocean]]. As for water vapor, the tritium concentration was approximately one order of magnitude greater than surface seawater concentrations (ranging from 0.46 to 1.15&nbsp;Bq/liter).<ref name="Tritium" /> Therefore, the water vapor tritium is not affected by the surface seawater concentration; thus, the high tritium concentrations in the vapor were concluded to be a direct consequence of the downward movement of natural tritium from the stratosphere to the troposphere (therefore, the ocean air showed a dependence on latitudinal change).<ref name="Tritium" />

In the [[North Pacific Ocean]], the tritium (introduced as bomb tritium in the Northern Hemisphere) spread in three dimensions. There were subsurface maxima in the middle and low latitude regions, which is indicative of lateral mixing (advection) and [[diffusion]] processes along lines of constant [[potential density]] ([[isopycnal]]s) in the upper ocean.<ref name="Circulation">{{Cite journal|author=Fine, Rana A.|title=Circulation of Tritium in the Pacific Ocean|journal=Journal of Physical Oceanography|volume=11|pages=3–14|doi=10.1175/1520-0485(1981)011<0003:COTITP>2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 1981JPO....11....3F|last2=Reid|first2=Joseph L.|last3=Östlund|first3=H. Göte|year=1981}}</ref> Some of these maxima even correlate well with [[salinity]] extrema.<ref name="Circulation" /> In order to obtain the structure for ocean circulation, the tritium concentrations were mapped on 3 surfaces of constant potential density (23.90, 26.02, and 26.81).<ref name="Circulation" /> Results indicated that the tritium was well-mixed (at 6 to 7&nbsp;TU) on the 26.81 isopycnal in the subarctic cyclonic gyre and there appeared to be a slow exchange of tritium (relative to shallower isopycnals) between this gyre and the anticyclonic gyre to the south; also, the tritium on the 23.90 and 26.02 surfaces appeared to be exchanged at a slower rate between the central gyre of the North Pacific and the equatorial regions.<ref name="Circulation" />

The depth penetration of bomb tritium can be separated into 3 distinct layers. Layer 1 is the shallowest layer and includes the deepest, ventilated layer in winter; it has received tritium via radioactive fallout and lost some due to advection and/or vertical diffusion and contains approximately 28% of the total amount of tritium.<ref name="Circulation" /> Layer 2 is below the first layer but above the 26.81 isopycnal and is no longer part of the mixed layer. Its 2 sources are diffusion downward from the mixed layer and lateral expansions outcropping strata (poleward); it contains about 58% of the total tritium.<ref name="Circulation" /> Layer 3 is representative of waters that are deeper than the outcrop isopycnal and can only receive tritium via vertical diffusion; it contains the remaining 14% of the total tritium.<ref name="Circulation" />

===Mississippi River System===
The impacts of the nuclear fallout{{Non sequitur|date=July 2017}} were felt in the United States throughout the [[Mississippi River System]]. Tritium concentrations can be used to understand the [[Residence time (fluid dynamics)|residence times]] of continental hydrologic systems (as opposed to the usual oceanic hydrologic systems) which include surface waters such as lakes, streams, and rivers.<ref name="Mississippi">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/hyp.1403|title=Tritium hydrology of the Mississippi River basin|year=2004|last1=Michel|first1=Robert L.|journal=Hydrological Processes|volume=18|page=1255|bibcode = 2004HyPr...18.1255M|issue=7}}</ref> Studying these systems can also provide societies and municipals with information for agricultural purposes and overall river water quality.

In a 2004 study, several rivers were taken into account during the examination of tritium concentrations (starting in the 1960s) throughout the Mississippi River Basin: [[Ohio River]] (largest input to the Mississippi River flow), [[Missouri River]], and [[Arkansas River]].<ref name="Mississippi" /> The largest tritium concentrations were found in 1963 at all the sampled locations throughout these rivers and correlate well with the peak concentrations in precipitation due to the nuclear bomb tests in 1962. The overall highest concentrations occurred in the Missouri River (1963) and were greater than 1,200&nbsp;TU while the lowest concentrations were found in the Arkansas River (never greater than 850&nbsp;TU and less than 10&nbsp;TU in the mid-1980s).<ref name="Mississippi" />

Several processes can be identified using the tritium data from the rivers: direct runoff and outflow of water from groundwater reservoirs.<ref name="Mississippi" /> Using these processes, it becomes possible to model the response of the river basins to the transient tritium tracer. Two of the most common models are the following:

*Piston-flow approach – tritium signal appears immediately; and
*Well-mixed reservoir approach – outflow concentration depends upon the residence time of the basin water<ref name="Mississippi" />

Unfortunately, both models fail to reproduce the tritium in river waters; thus, a two-member mixing model was developed that consists of 2 components: a prompt-flow component (recent precipitation – "piston") and a component where waters reside in the basin for longer than 1&nbsp;year ("well-mixed reservoir").<ref name="Mississippi" /> Therefore, the basin tritium concentration becomes a function of the residence times within the basin, sinks (radioactive decay) or sources of tritium, and the input function.

For the Ohio River, the tritium data indicated that about 40% of the flow was composed of precipitation with residence times of less than 1&nbsp;year (in the Ohio basin) and older waters consisted of residence times of about 10&nbsp;years.<ref name="Mississippi" /> Thus, the short residence times (less than 1&nbsp;year) corresponded to the "prompt-flow" component of the two-member mixing model. As for the Missouri River, results indicated that residence times were approximately 4&nbsp;years with the prompt-flow component being around 10% (these results are due to the series of dams in the area of the Missouri River).<ref name="Mississippi" />

As for the mass flux of tritium through the main stem of the Mississippi River into the [[Gulf of Mexico]], data indicated that approximately 780&nbsp;grams of tritium has flowed out of the River and into the Gulf between 1961 and 1997.<ref name="Mississippi" /> And current fluxes through the Mississippi River are about 1 to 2&nbsp;grams per year as opposed to the pre-bomb period fluxes of roughly 0.4&nbsp;grams per year.<ref name="Mississippi" />

'''Deoxyribonucleic acid''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Deoxyribonucleic_acid.ogg|d|i|ˈ|ɒ|k|s|i|ˌ|r|aɪ|b|oʊ|nj|ʊ|ˌ|k|l|iː|ɪ|k|,_|-|ˌ|k|l|eɪ|ɪ|k}};<ref>{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|deoxyribonucleic acid}}</ref> '''DNA''') is a thread-like chain of [[nucleotides]] carrying the [[genetics|genetic]] instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and [[reproduction]] of all known living [[organism]]s and many [[virus]]es. DNA and [[ribonucleic acid]] (RNA) are [[nucleic acid]]s; alongside [[protein]]s, [[lipids]] and complex carbohydrates ([[polysaccharide]]s), they are one of the four major types of [[macromolecule]]s that are essential for all known forms of [[life]]. Most DNA molecules consist of two [[biopolymer]] strands coiled around each other to form a [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix]].

The two DNA strands are called [[polynucleotide]]s since they are composed of simpler [[monomer]] units called [[nucleotide]]s.<ref>{{Cite book |vauthors= Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts K, Walter P |title= Molecular Biology of the Cell |edition= 6th |publisher= Garland |year= 2014 |url= http://www.garlandscience.com/product/isbn/9780815344322 |page= Chapter 4: DNA, Chromosomes and Genomes |isbn= 9780815344322 |deadurl= no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140714210549/http://www.garlandscience.com/product/isbn/9780815344322 |archive-date= 14 July 2014 |df= dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Purcell|first1=Adam|name-list-format=vanc|title=DNA|url=http://basicbiology.net/micro/genetics/dna|website=Basic Biology|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105045651/http://basicbiology.net/micro/genetics/dna/|archive-date=5 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Each nucleotide is composed of one of four [[nitrogenous base|nitrogen-containing]] [[nucleobase]]s ([[cytosine]] [C], [[guanine]] [G], [[adenine]] [A] or [[thymine]] [T]), a [[monosaccharide|sugar]] called [[deoxyribose]], and a [[phosphate group]]. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by [[covalent bond]]s between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating [[backbone chain|sugar-phosphate backbone]]. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to [[base pair]]ing rules (A with T and C with G), with [[hydrogen bond]]s to make double-stranded DNA.

The complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups, pyrimidines and purines. In a DNA molecule, the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine, the purines are adenine and guanine.

DNA stores biological [[information]]. The DNA [[Backbone chain|backbone]] is resistant to [[Bond cleavage|cleavage]], and both strands of the double-stranded structure store the same biological information. This information is replicated as and when the two strands separate. A large part of DNA (more than 98% for humans) is [[non-coding DNA|non-coding]], meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences.

The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are thus [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]]. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (informally, ''bases''). It is the [[Nucleic acid sequence|sequence]] of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes biological information. [[RNA]] strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a process called [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. Under the [[genetic code]], these [[RNA]] strands are translated to specify the sequence of [[amino acid]]s within proteins in a process called [[translation (genetics)|translation]].

Within eukaryotic cells DNA is organized into long structures called [[chromosome]]s. During [[cell division]] these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of [[DNA replication]], providing each cell its own complete set of chromosomes. [[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic organisms]] ([[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[protist]]s) store most of their DNA inside the [[cell nucleus]] and some of their DNA in [[organelle]]s, such as [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] or [[chloroplast]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last= Russell |first= Peter | name-list-format = vanc | title= iGenetics |publisher= Benjamin Cummings |location= New York |year= 2001 |isbn= 0-8053-4553-1}}</ref> In contrast [[prokaryote]]s ([[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]) store their DNA only in the [[cytoplasm]]. Within the eukaryotic chromosomes, [[chromatin]] proteins such as [[histone]]s compact and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.

DNA was first isolated by [[Friedrich Miescher]] in 1869. Its molecular structure was first identified by [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] within the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1953, whose model-building efforts were guided by [[X-ray diffraction]] data acquired by [[Raymond Gosling]], who was a post-graduate student of [[Rosalind Franklin]]. DNA is used by researchers as a molecular tool to explore physical laws and theories, such as the [[ergodic theorem]] and the theory of [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]. The unique material properties of DNA have made it an attractive molecule for material scientists and engineers interested in micro- and nano-fabrication. Among notable advances in this field are [[DNA origami]] and DNA-based hybrid materials.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mashaghi A, Katan A |title=A physicist's view of DNA |journal=De Physicus|volume=24e |issue=3 |pages=59–61 |year=2013 |arxiv= 1311.2545v1 |bibcode=2013arXiv1311.2545M}}</ref>

===Nucleobase classification===
The nucleobases are classified into two types: the [[purine]]s, A and G, being fused five- and six-membered [[heterocyclic compound]]s, and the [[pyrimidine]]s, the six-membered rings C and T.<ref name=berg/> A fifth pyrimidine nucleobase, [[uracil]] (U), usually takes the place of thymine in RNA and differs from thymine by lacking a [[methyl group]] on its ring. In addition to RNA and DNA, many artificial [[nucleic acid analogue]]s have been created to study the properties of nucleic acids, or for use in biotechnology.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Verma S, Eckstein F | title = Modified oligonucleotides: synthesis and strategy for users | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 67 | pages = 99–134 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9759484 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.67.1.99 }}</ref>

The reason for the presence of these non canonical bases in DNA is not known. It seems likely that at least part of the reason for their presence in bacterial viruses (phages) is to avoid the [[restriction enzyme]]s present in bacteria. This enzyme system acts at least in part as a molecular immune system protecting bacteria from infection by viruses.

===Grooves===
Twin helical strands form the DNA backbone. Another double helix may be found tracing the spaces, or grooves, between the strands. These voids are adjacent to the base pairs and may provide a [[binding site]]. As the strands are not symmetrically located with respect to each other, the grooves are unequally sized. One groove, the major groove, is 22&nbsp;[[Ångström|Å]] wide and the other, the minor groove, is 12&nbsp;Å wide.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wing R, Drew H, Takano T, Broka C, Tanaka S, Itakura K, Dickerson RE | title = Crystal structure analysis of a complete turn of B-DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 287 | issue = 5784 | pages = 755–8 | date = October 1980 | pmid = 7432492 | doi = 10.1038/287755a0 | bibcode = 1980Natur.287..755W }}</ref> The width of the major groove means that the edges of the bases are more accessible in the major groove than in the minor groove.

===Base pairing===
{{further information|Base pair}}

In a DNA double helix, each type of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called complementary [[base pair]]ing. Here, purines form [[hydrogen bond]]s to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix is called a Watson-Crick base pair. Another type of base pairing is Hoogsteen base pairing where two hydrogen bonds form between guanine and cytosine.<ref name="pmid23818176">{{cite journal |vauthors=Nikolova EN, Zhou H, Gottardo FL, Alvey HS, Kimsey IJ, Al-Hashimi HM |title=A historical account of Hoogsteen base-pairs in duplex DNA |journal=Biopolymers |volume=99 |issue=12 |pages=955–68 |year=2013 |pmid=23818176 |pmc=3844552 |doi=10.1002/bip.22334 |url=}}</ref> As hydrogen bonds are not [[covalent bond|covalent]], they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily.

The two types of base pairs form different numbers of hydrogen bonds, AT forming two hydrogen bonds, and GC forming three hydrogen bonds (see figures, right).
DNA with high [[GC-content]] is more stable than DNA with low GC-content.

{{Anchor|ssDNA}}
As noted above, most DNA molecules are actually two polymer strands, bound together in a helical fashion by noncovalent bonds; this double-stranded ('''dsDNA''') structure is maintained largely by the intrastrand base stacking interactions, which are strongest for G,C stacks. The two strands can come apart&nbsp;– a process known as melting&nbsp;– to form two single-stranded DNA ('''ssDNA''') molecules. Melting occurs at high temperature, low salt and high [[pH]] (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used).

The stability of the dsDNA form depends not only on the GC-content (% G,C basepairs) but also on sequence (since stacking is sequence specific) and also length (longer molecules are more stable). The stability can be measured in various ways; a common way is the "melting temperature", which is the temperature at which 50% of the ds molecules are converted to ss molecules; melting temperature is dependent on ionic strength and the concentration of DNA.
As a result, it is both the percentage of GC base pairs and the overall length of a DNA double helix that determines the strength of the association between the two strands of DNA. Long DNA helices with a high GC-content have stronger-interacting strands, while short helices with high AT content have weaker-interacting strands.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chalikian TV, Völker J, Plum GE, Breslauer KJ | title = A more unified picture for the thermodynamics of nucleic acid duplex melting: a characterization by calorimetric and volumetric techniques | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 96 | issue = 14 | pages = 7853–8 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 10393911 | pmc = 22151 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.14.7853 | bibcode = 1999PNAS...96.7853C }}</ref> In biology, parts of the DNA double helix that need to separate easily, such as the TATAAT [[Pribnow box]] in some [[promoter (biology)|promoters]], tend to have a high AT content, making the strands easier to pull apart.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = deHaseth PL, Helmann JD | title = Open complex formation by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase: the mechanism of polymerase-induced strand separation of double helical DNA | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 817–24 | date = June 1995 | pmid = 7476180 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.1995.tb02309.x }}</ref>

In the laboratory, the strength of this interaction can be measured by finding the temperature necessary to break the hydrogen bonds, their [[DNA melting|melting temperature]] (also called ''T<sub>m</sub>'' value). When all the base pairs in a DNA double helix melt, the strands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules. These single-stranded DNA molecules have no single common shape, but some conformations are more stable than others.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Isaksson J, Acharya S, Barman J, Cheruku P, Chattopadhyaya J | title = Single-stranded adenine-rich DNA and RNA retain structural characteristics of their respective double-stranded conformations and show directional differences in stacking pattern | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 43 | issue = 51 | pages = 15996–6010 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15609994 | doi = 10.1021/bi048221v | url = http://www.boc.uu.se/boc14www/thesis/johan2005/Paper%20V/Paper%20V.pdf | deadurl = no | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070610205112/http://www.boc.uu.se/boc14www/thesis/johan2005/Paper%20V/Paper%20V.pdf | archive-date = 10 June 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

===Sense and antisense===
{{further information|Sense (molecular biology)}}

A DNA sequence is called "sense" if its sequence is the same as that of a [[messenger RNA]] copy that is translated into protein.<ref>[http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/newsletter/misc/DNA.html Designation of the two strands of DNA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424015915/http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/newsletter/misc/DNA.html |date=24 April 2008 }} JCBN/NC-IUB Newsletter 1989. Retrieved 7 May 2008</ref> The sequence on the opposite strand is called the "antisense" sequence. Both sense and antisense sequences can exist on different parts of the same strand of DNA (i.e. both strands can contain both sense and antisense sequences). In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, antisense RNA sequences are produced, but the functions of these RNAs are not entirely clear.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hüttenhofer A, Schattner P, Polacek N | title = Non-coding RNAs: hope or hype? | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 289–97 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15851066 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2005.03.007 }}</ref> One proposal is that antisense RNAs are involved in regulating [[gene expression]] through RNA-RNA base pairing.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Munroe SH | title = Diversity of antisense regulation in eukaryotes: multiple mechanisms, emerging patterns | journal = Journal of Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 93 | issue = 4 | pages = 664–71 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15389973 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.20252 }}</ref>

A few DNA sequences in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and more in [[plasmid]]s and [[virus]]es, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having [[overlapping gene]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Makalowska I, Lin CF, Makalowski W | title = Overlapping genes in vertebrate genomes | journal = Computational Biology and Chemistry | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–12 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15680581 | doi = 10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2004.12.006 }}</ref> In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read in the opposite direction along the other strand.

===Supercoiling===
{{further information|DNA supercoil}}
DNA can be twisted like a rope in a process called [[DNA supercoil]]ing. With DNA in its "relaxed" state, a strand usually circles the axis of the double helix once every 10.4 base pairs, but if the DNA is twisted the strands become more tightly or more loosely wound.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Benham CJ, Mielke SP | title = DNA mechanics | journal = Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering | volume = 7 | pages = 21–53 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16004565 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bioeng.6.062403.132016 }}</ref> If the DNA is twisted in the direction of the helix, this is positive supercoiling, and the bases are held more tightly together. If they are twisted in the opposite direction, this is negative supercoiling, and the bases come apart more easily.

At the ends of the linear chromosomes are specialized regions of DNA called [[telomere]]s.

These guanine-rich sequences may stabilize chromosome ends by forming structures of stacked sets of four-base units, rather than the usual base pairs found in other DNA molecules.

===Branched DNA===
{{further information|Branched DNA|DNA nanotechnology}}

In DNA, [[DNA end#Frayed ends|fraying]] occurs when non-complementary regions exist at the end of an otherwise complementary double-strand of DNA. However, branched DNA can occur if a third strand of DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to hybridize with the frayed regions of the pre-existing double-strand. Although the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three strands of DNA, complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also possible.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Seeman NC | title = DNA enables nanoscale control of the structure of matter | journal = Quarterly Reviews of Biophysics | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 363–71 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16515737 | pmc = 3478329 | doi = 10.1017/S0033583505004087 }}</ref> Branched DNA can be used in [[nanotechnology]] to construct geometric shapes, see the section on [[DNA#Uses in technology|uses in technology]] below.

===Base modifications and DNA packaging===
{{further information|DNA methylation|Chromatin remodeling}}
The expression of genes is influenced by how the DNA is packaged in chromosomes, in a structure called [[chromatin]]. Base modifications can be involved in packaging, with regions that have low or no gene expression usually containing high levels of [[methylation]] of [[cytosine]] bases. DNA packaging and its influence on gene expression can also occur by covalent modifications of the [[histone]] protein core around which DNA is wrapped in the chromatin structure or else by remodeling carried out by chromatin remodeling complexes (see [[Chromatin remodeling]]). There is, further, [[Crosstalk (biology)|crosstalk]] between DNA methylation and histone modification, so they can coordinately affect chromatin and gene expression.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hu Q, Rosenfeld MG | title = Epigenetic regulation of human embryonic stem cells | journal = Frontiers in Genetics | volume = 3 | pages = 238 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23133442 | pmc = 3488762 | doi = 10.3389/fgene.2012.00238 }}</ref>

Many mutagens fit into the space between two adjacent base pairs, this is called ''[[intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalation]]''. Most intercalators are [[aromaticity|aromatic]] and planar molecules; examples include [[ethidium bromide]], [[acridine]]s, [[Daunorubicin|daunomycin]], and [[doxorubicin]].

==Biological functions==
[[File:Eukaryote DNA-en.svg|thumb|320px|Location of eukaryote [[nuclear DNA]] within the chromosomes.]]
DNA usually occurs as linear [[chromosome]]s in [[eukaryote]]s, and circular chromosomes in [[prokaryote]]s. The set of chromosomes in a cell makes up its [[genome]]; the [[human genome]] has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes.<ref name = "Venter_2001"/> The information carried by DNA is held in the [[DNA sequence|sequence]] of pieces of DNA called [[gene]]s. [[Transmission (genetics)|Transmission]] of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing. For example, in transcription, when a cell uses the information in a gene, the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides. Usually, this RNA copy is then used to make a matching [[Peptide sequence|protein sequence]] in a process called [[Translation (biology)|translation]], which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides. In alternative fashion, a cell may simply copy its genetic information in a process called DNA replication. The details of these functions are covered in other articles; here the focus is on the interactions between DNA and other molecules that mediate the function of the genome.

===Genes and genomes===
{{further information|Cell nucleus|Chromatin|Chromosome|Gene|Noncoding DNA}}
Genomic DNA is tightly and orderly packed in the process called [[DNA condensation]], to fit the small available volumes of the cell. In eukaryotes, DNA is located in the [[cell nucleus]], with small amounts in [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s.

In many [[species]], only a small fraction of the total sequence of the [[genome]] encodes protein.

===Transcription and translation===
{{further information|Genetic code|Transcription (genetics)|Protein biosynthesis}}
A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the [[phenotype]] of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a [[messenger RNA]] sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the [[amino acid|amino-acid]] sequences of proteins is determined by the rules of [[Translation (biology)|translation]], known collectively as the [[genetic code]]. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called ''codons'' formed from a sequence of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).

In transcription, the codons of a gene are copied into messenger RNA by [[RNA polymerase]]. This RNA copy is then decoded by a [[ribosome]] that reads the RNA sequence by base-pairing the messenger RNA to [[transfer RNA]], which carries amino acids. Since there are 4 bases in 3-letter combinations, there are 64 possible codons (4<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;combinations). These encode the twenty [[list of standard amino acids|standard amino acids]], giving most amino acids more than one possible codon. There are also three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying the end of the coding region; these are the TAA, TGA, and TAG codons.

[[File:DNA replication en.svg|thumb|450px|right|DNA replication. The double helix is unwound by a [[helicase]] and [[topoisomerase]]. Next, one [[DNA polymerase]] produces the [[Replication fork|leading strand]] copy. Another DNA polymerase binds to the [[Replication fork|lagging strand]]. This enzyme makes discontinuous segments (called [[Okazaki fragment]]s) before [[DNA ligase]] joins them together.]]

===Replication===
{{further information|DNA replication}}

[[Cell division]] is essential for an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for [[DNA replication]]. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's [[complementary DNA]] sequence is recreated by an [[enzyme]] called [[DNA polymerase]]. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Albà M | title = Replicative DNA polymerases | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = REVIEWS3002 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11178285 | pmc = 150442 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2001-2-1-reviews3002 | nopp = true }}</ref> In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.

==Interactions with proteins==
All the functions of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These [[protein interactions]] can be non-specific, or the protein can bind specifically to a single DNA sequence. Enzymes can also bind to DNA and of these, the polymerases that copy the DNA base sequence in transcription and DNA replication are particularly important.

Structural proteins that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA is held in complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called [[chromatin]]. In eukaryotes, this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called [[histone]]s, while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sandman K, Pereira SL, Reeve JN | title = Diversity of prokaryotic chromosomal proteins and the origin of the nucleosome | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 54 | issue = 12 | pages = 1350–64 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9893710 | doi = 10.1007/s000180050259 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dame RT | title = The role of nucleoid-associated proteins in the organization and compaction of bacterial chromatin | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 56 | issue = 4 | pages = 858–70 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15853876 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2005.04598.x }}</ref> The histones form a disk-shaped complex called a [[nucleosome]], which contains two complete turns of double-stranded DNA wrapped around its surface.

In contrast, other proteins have evolved to bind to particular DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various [[transcription factor]]s, which are proteins that regulate transcription. Each transcription factor binds to one particular set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the transcription of genes that have these sequences close to their promoters. The transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Myers LC, Kornberg RD | title = Mediator of transcriptional regulation | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 69 | pages = 729–49 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10966474 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.69.1.729 }}</ref> Alternatively, transcription factors can bind [[enzyme]]s that modify the histones at the promoter. This changes the accessibility of the DNA template to the polymerase.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Spiegelman BM, Heinrich R | title = Biological control through regulated transcriptional coactivators | journal = Cell | volume = 119 | issue = 2 | pages = 157–67 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15479634 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2004.09.037 }}</ref>

As these DNA targets can occur throughout an organism's genome, changes in the activity of one type of transcription factor can affect thousands of genes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Li Z, Van Calcar S, Qu C, Cavenee WK, Zhang MQ, Ren B | title = A global transcriptional regulatory role for c-Myc in Burkitt's lymphoma cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 14 | pages = 8164–9 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12808131 | pmc = 166200 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1332764100 | bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.8164L }}</ref> Consequently, these proteins are often the targets of the [[signal transduction]] processes that control responses to environmental changes or [[cellular differentiation]] and development.

===DNA-modifying enzymes===

====Nucleases and ligases====
[[Nuclease]]s are [[enzyme]]s that cut DNA strands by catalyzing the [[hydrolysis]] of the [[phosphodiester bond]]s. Nucleases that hydrolyse nucleotides from the ends of DNA strands are called [[exonuclease]]s, while [[endonuclease]]s cut within strands. The most frequently used nucleases in [[molecular biology]] are the [[restriction enzyme|restriction endonucleases]], which cut DNA at specific sequences. For instance, the EcoRV enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6-base sequence 5′-GATATC-3′ and makes a cut at the horizontal line. In nature, these enzymes protect [[bacteria]] against [[Bacteriophage|phage]] infection by digesting the phage DNA when it enters the bacterial cell, acting as part of the [[restriction modification system]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bickle TA, Krüger DH | title = Biology of DNA restriction | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 434–50 | date = June 1993 | pmid = 8336674 | pmc = 372918 }}</ref> In technology, these sequence-specific nucleases are used in [[molecular cloning]] and [[Genetic fingerprinting|DNA fingerprinting]].

They are also used in [[DNA repair]] and [[genetic recombination]].<ref name=Doherty/>

====Topoisomerases and helicases====
[[Topoisomerase]]s are enzymes with both nuclease and ligase activity. These proteins change the amount of [[DNA supercoil|supercoiling]] in DNA. Some of these enzymes work by cutting the DNA helix and allowing one section to rotate, thereby reducing its level of supercoiling; the enzyme then seals the DNA break.<ref name=Champoux/> Other types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA helix and then passing a second strand of DNA through this break, before rejoining the helix.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schoeffler AJ, Berger JM | title = Recent advances in understanding structure-function relationships in the type II topoisomerase mechanism | journal = Biochemical Society Transactions | volume = 33 | issue = Pt 6 | pages = 1465–70 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16246147 | doi = 10.1042/BST20051465 }}</ref> Topoisomerases are required for many processes involving DNA, such as DNA replication and transcription.<ref name=Wang/>

[[Helicase]]s are proteins that are a type of [[molecular motor]]. They use the chemical energy in [[nucleoside triphosphate]]s, predominantly [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), to break hydrogen bonds between bases and unwind the DNA double helix into single strands.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tuteja N, Tuteja R | title = Unraveling DNA helicases.

====Polymerases====
[[Polymerase]]s are [[enzyme]]s that synthesize polynucleotide chains from [[nucleoside triphosphate]]s. The sequence of their products is created based on existing polynucleotide chains—which are called ''templates''. These enzymes function by repeatedly adding a nucleotide to the 3′ [[hydroxyl]] group at the end of the growing polynucleotide chain. As a consequence, all polymerases work in a 5′ to 3′ direction.<ref name=Joyce>{{cite journal | vauthors = Joyce CM, Steitz TA | title = Polymerase structures and function: variations on a theme? | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 177 | issue = 22 | pages = 6321–9 | date = November 1995 | pmid = 7592405 | pmc = 177480 | doi=10.1128/jb.177.22.6321-6329.1995}}</ref> In the [[active site]] of these enzymes, the incoming nucleoside triphosphate base-pairs to the template: this allows polymerases to accurately synthesize the complementary strand of their template. Polymerases are classified according to the type of template that they use.

In DNA replication, DNA-dependent [[DNA polymerase]]s make copies of DNA polynucleotide chains. To preserve biological information, it is essential that the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of bases in the template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a [[Proofreading (biology)|proofreading]] activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3′ to 5′ [[exonuclease]] activity is activated and the incorrect base removed.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hubscher U, Maga G, Spadari S | title = Eukaryotic DNA polymerases | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 71 | pages = 133–63 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12045093 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.71.090501.150041 }}</ref> In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the [[replisome]] that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the [[DNA clamp]] or [[helicase]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnson A, O'Donnell M | title = Cellular DNA replicases: components and dynamics at the replication fork | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 74 | pages = 283–315 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15952889 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.73.011303.073859 }}</ref>

RNA-dependent DNA polymerases are a specialized class of polymerases that copy the sequence of an RNA strand into DNA. They include [[reverse transcriptase]], which is a [[virus|viral]] enzyme involved in the infection of cells by [[retrovirus]]es, and [[telomerase]], which is required for the replication of telomeres.<ref name=Greider/><ref name=Tarrago-Litvak1994>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tarrago-Litvak L, Andréola ML, Nevinsky GA, Sarih-Cottin L, Litvak S | title = The reverse transcriptase of HIV-1: from enzymology to therapeutic intervention | journal = FASEB Journal | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = 497–503 | date = May 1994 | pmid = 7514143 }}</ref> For example, HIV reverse transcriptase is an enzyme for AIDS virus replication.<ref name=Tarrago-Litvak1994/> Telomerase is an unusual polymerase because it contains its own RNA template as part of its structure. It synthesizes [[telomeres]] at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres prevent fusion of the ends of neighboring chromosomes and protect chromosome ends from damage.<ref name=Nugent/>

Transcription is carried out by a DNA-dependent [[RNA polymerase]] that copies the sequence of a DNA strand into RNA. To begin transcribing a gene, the RNA polymerase binds to a sequence of DNA called a promoter and separates the DNA strands. It then copies the gene sequence into a [[messenger RNA]] transcript until it reaches a region of DNA called the [[terminator (genetics)|terminator]], where it halts and detaches from the DNA. As with human DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, [[RNA polymerase II]], the enzyme that transcribes most of the genes in the human genome, operates as part of a large [[protein complex]] with multiple regulatory and accessory subunits.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Martinez E | title = Multi-protein complexes in eukaryotic gene transcription | journal = Plant Molecular Biology | volume = 50 | issue = 6 | pages = 925–47 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12516863 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021258713850 }}</ref>

{{further information|Genetic recombination}}
[[File:Chromosomal Recombination.svg|thumb|250px|left|Recombination involves the breaking and rejoining of two chromosomes (M and F) to produce two rearranged chromosomes (C1 and C2).]]

A DNA helix usually does not interact with other segments of DNA, and in human cells, the different chromosomes even occupy separate areas in the nucleus called "[[chromosome territories]]".<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cremer T, Cremer C | title = Chromosome territories, nuclear architecture and gene regulation in mammalian cells | journal = Nature Reviews. Genetics | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 292–301 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 11283701 | doi = 10.1038/35066075 }}</ref> This physical separation of different chromosomes is important for the ability of DNA to function as a stable repository for information, as one of the few times chromosomes interact is in [[chromosomal crossover]] which occurs during [[sexual reproduction]], when [[genetic recombination]] occurs. Chromosomal crossover is when two DNA helices break, swap a section and then rejoin.

Recombination allows chromosomes to exchange genetic information and produces new combinations of genes, which increases the efficiency of [[natural selection]] and can be important in the rapid evolution of new proteins.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pál C, Papp B, Lercher MJ | title = An integrated view of protein evolution | journal = Nature Reviews.

The most common form of chromosomal crossover is [[homologous recombination]], where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. Non-homologous recombination can be damaging to cells, as it can produce [[chromosomal translocation]]s and genetic abnormalities. The recombination reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as [[recombinase]]s, such as [[RAD51]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vispé S, Defais M | title = Mammalian Rad51 protein: a RecA homologue with pleiotropic functions | journal = Biochimie | volume = 79 | issue = 9–10 | pages = 587–92 | date = October 1997 | pmid = 9466696 | doi = 10.1016/S0300-9084(97)82007-X }}</ref> The first step in recombination is a double-stranded break caused by either an [[endonuclease]] or damage to the DNA.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Neale MJ, Keeney S | title = Clarifying the mechanics of DNA strand exchange in meiotic recombination | journal = Nature | volume = 442 | issue = 7099 | pages = 153–8 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16838012 | doi = 10.1038/nature04885 | bibcode = 2006Natur.442..153N | pmc = 5607947 }}</ref> A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one [[Holliday junction]], in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the pair of chromosomes, swapping one strand for another. The recombination reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dickman MJ, Ingleston SM, Sedelnikova SE, Rafferty JB, Lloyd RG, Grasby JA, Hornby DP | title = The RuvABC resolvasome | journal = European Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 269 | issue = 22 | pages = 5492–501 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12423347 | doi = 10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.03250.x }}</ref> Only strands of like polarity exchange DNA during recombination. There are two types of cleavage: east-west cleavage and north-south cleavage. The north-south cleavage nicks both strands of DNA, while the east-west cleavage has one strand of DNA intact. The formation of a Holliday junction during recombination makes it possible for genetic diversity, genes to exchange on chromosomes, and expression of wild-type viral genomes.

The development of forensic science and the ability to now obtain genetic matching on minute samples of blood, skin, saliva, or hair has led to re-examining many cases. Evidence can now be uncovered that was scientifically impossible at the time of the original examination. Combined with the removal of the [[double jeopardy]] law in some places, this can allow cases to be reopened where prior trials have failed to produce sufficient evidence to convince a jury. People charged with serious crimes may be required to provide a sample of DNA for matching purposes. The most obvious defense to DNA matches obtained forensically is to claim that cross-contamination of evidence has occurred. This has resulted in meticulous strict handling procedures with new cases of serious crime.
DNA profiling is also used successfully to positively identify victims of mass casualty incidents,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://massfatality.dna.gov/Introduction/ |title=DNA Identification in Mass Fatality Incidents |date=September 2006 |publisher=National Institute of Justice |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061112000837/http://massfatality.dna.gov/Introduction/ |archive-date=12 November 2006 |df= }}</ref> bodies or body parts in serious accidents, and individual victims in mass war graves, via matching to family members.

Because DNA collects mutations over time, which are then inherited, it contains historical information, and, by comparing DNA sequences, geneticists can infer the evolutionary history of organisms, their [[Phylogenetics|phylogeny]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wray GA | title = Dating branches on the tree of life using DNA | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = REVIEWS0001 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11806830 | pmc = 150454 | doi = 10.1046/j.1525-142X.1999.99010.x | nopp = true }}</ref> This field of phylogenetics is a powerful tool in [[evolutionary biology]].

===Information storage===
{{main article|DNA digital data storage}}
In a paper published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in January 2013, scientists from the [[European Bioinformatics Institute]] and [[Agilent Technologies]] proposed a mechanism to use DNA's ability to code information as a means of digital data storage. The group was able to encode 739 kilobytes of data into DNA code, synthesize the actual DNA, then sequence the DNA and decode the information back to its original form, with a reported 100% accuracy. The encoded information consisted of text files and audio files. A prior experiment was published in August 2012. It was conducted by researchers at [[Harvard University]], where the text of a 54,000-word book was encoded in DNA.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldman N, Bertone P, Chen S, Dessimoz C, LeProust EM, Sipos B, Birney E | title = Towards practical, high-capacity, low-maintenance information storage in synthesized DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 494 | issue = 7435 | pages = 77–80 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23354052 | pmc = 3672958 | doi = 10.1038/nature11875 | bibcode = 2013Natur.494...77G }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Naik|first=Gautam|title=Storing Digital Data in DNA|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324539304578259883507543150|accessdate=24 January 2013|newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=24 January 2013|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150124080051/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324539304578259883507543150|archive-date=24 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In 1927, [[Nikolai Koltsov]] proposed that inherited traits would be inherited via a "giant hereditary molecule" made up of "two mirror strands that would replicate in a semi-conservative fashion using each strand as a template".<ref>Koltsov proposed that a cell's genetic information was encoded in a long chain of amino acids.

'''Leucine''' (abbreviated as '''Leu''' or '''L''') is an α-[[amino acid]] that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-[[amino group]] (which is in the protonated −NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> form under biological conditions), an α-[[Carboxylic acid|carboxylic acid group]] (which is in the deprotonated −COO<sup>−</sup> form under biological conditions), and a side chain [[Isobutyl|isobutyl group]], making it a [[Chemical polarity|non-polar]] [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] amino acid. It is [[Essential amino acid|essential]] in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it: it must be obtained from the diet. Human dietary sources are foods that contain protein, such as meats, dairy products, soy products, beans and other legumes. In the [[genetic code]] it is encoded by the six [[codon]]s UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, and CUG.

Like [[valine]] and [[isoleucine]], leucine is a [[Branched-chain amino acid|branched-chain]] amino acid. Because the products of its breakdown are [[acetyl-CoA]] and [[acetoacetate]], it is one of the two exclusively [[ketogenic amino acid]]s, [[lysine]] being the other one.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sSyMAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA266|title=Biochemistry|last=Ferrier|first=Denise R.|date=2013-05-24|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=9781451175622|language=en}}</ref> It is the most important ketogenic amino acid in humans.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=X3DK4nWybaMC|title=Metabolic & Therapeutic Aspects of Amino Acids in Clinical Nutrition, Second Edition|last=Cynober|first=Luc A.|date=2003-11-13|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780203010266|language=en}}</ref><sup>p.&nbsp;101</sup>

==Biology==
Leucine is used in the [[liver]], [[adipose tissue]], and [[muscle tissue]]. Adipose and muscle tissue use leucine in the formation of [[sterol]]s. Combined leucine use in these two tissues is seven times greater than in the liver.<ref>{{cite web | author=J. Rosenthal, et al. Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada | title=Metabolic fate of leucine: A significant sterol precursor in adipose tissue and muscle | work= American Journal of Physiology Vol. 226, No. 2, p. 411-418 | url=http://ajplegacy.physiology.org/cgi/reprint/226/2/411 | accessdate=25 March 2008}}</ref>

Leucine is rapidly taken up into the brain where astrocytes convert it to alpha-ketoisocaproate via transamination of alpha-ketoglutarate to glutamate. [reference: Yudoff, Mark. (Feb 01 2017) "Interactions in the Metabolism of Glutamate and the Branched-Chain Amino Acids and ketoacids in the CNS" Neurochem Res. 2017 January; 42(1): 10-18. doi:10.1007/s11064-016-2057-z. ]

===Effects===
Leucine is an [[mTOR]] activator. It is a dietary amino acid with the capacity to directly stimulate muscle protein synthesis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Etzel MR | title = Manufacture and use of dairy protein fractions | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 134 | issue = 4 | pages = 996S-1002S | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15051860 | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/content/134/4/996S.long }}</ref> As a dietary supplement, leucine has been found to slow the degradation of muscle tissue by increasing the synthesis of muscle proteins in aged rats.<ref>{{cite web | author=L.

Factors such as lifestyle choices, age, gender, diet, exercise, etc. must be factored into the analyses to isolate the effects of supplemental leucine as a standalone, or if taken with other [[branched chain amino acid]]s (BCAAs).

=== Biosynthesis in plants===
Leucine is an essential amino acid in the diet of animals because they lack the complete enzyme pathway to synthesize it ''de novo'' from potential precursor compounds. Consequently, they must ingest it, usually as a component of proteins. Plants and microorganisms synthesize leucine from [[pyruvic acid]] with a series of enzymes:<ref>Nelson, D. L.; Cox, M. M. "Lehninger, Principles of Biochemistry" 3rd Ed. Worth Publishing: New York, 2000. {{ISBN|1-57259-153-6}}.</ref>

* Acetohydroxy acid isomero[[reductase]]
* [[Dihydroxyacid dehydratase]]
* α-Isopropylmalate [[synthase]]
* α-Isopropylmalate [[isomerase]]
* Leucine [[aminotransferase]]
Synthesis of the small, hydrophobic amino acid [[valine]] also includes the initial part of this pathway.

'''Thymidine''' ('''deoxythymidine'''; other names '''deoxyribosylthymine''', '''thymine deoxyriboside''') is a [[pyrimidine]] [[nucleoside|deoxynucleoside]].  Deoxythymidine is the [[DNA]] [[nucleoside]] T, which pairs with [[deoxyadenosine]] (A) in double-stranded DNA. In cell biology it is used to [[cell synchronization|synchronize]] the cells in G1/early S phase.

Before the boom in thymidine use caused by the need for thymidine in the production of the [[antiretroviral drug]] [[Zidovudine|azidothymidine]] (AZT), much of the world's thymidine production came from [[herring]] sperm.<ref>{{citation|title=
Enzymatic Production of 5-Methyluridine from Purine Nucleosides and Thymine by Erwinia carotovora AJ-2992|author1=Makoto Ishii |author2=Hideyuki Shirae |author3=Kenzo Yokozeko |publisher=Agricultural and Biological Chemistry}}</ref> Thymidine occurs almost exclusively in DNA but it also occurs in the [[T arm|T-loop]] of [[tRNA]].

==Structure and properties==
In its composition, deoxythymidine is a [[nucleoside]] composed of [[deoxyribose]] (a pentose [[sugar]]) joined to the [[pyrimidine]] base [[thymine]].

Deoxythymidine can be phosphorylated with one, two or three phosphoric acid groups, creating [[dTMP]] ('''d'''eoxy'''t'''hymidine '''m'''ono'''p'''hosphate), [[dTDP]], or [[dTTP]] (for the '''d'''i- and '''t'''ri- phosphates, respectively).

It exists in [[solid]] form as small white [[crystals]] or white crystalline [[Powder (substance)|powder]]. It has a [[molecular weight]] of 242.229&nbsp;[[unified atomic mass unit|u]] and a [[melting point]] of 185&nbsp;[[degrees Celsius|°C]]. The stability of deoxythymidine under [[standard temperature and pressure]] (STP) is very high.

Deoxythymidine is non-toxic and as part of one of the four nucleosides in DNA it is a naturally occurring compound that exists in all living organisms and DNA viruses. Instead of thymidine, RNA contains [[uridine]] ([[uracil]] joined to [[ribose]]). Uracil is chemically very similar to thymine, which is also known as 5-methyluracil. Since thymine nucleotides are precursors of DNA (but not RNA), the prefix "deoxy" is often left out, i.e., deoxythymidine is often just called thymidine.

Thymidine is listed as a chemical [[teratogen]].<ref>The following list of chemicals known or believed to be teratogens is drawn primarily from Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, 7th Ed., by N. Irving Sax and Richard J. Lewis.</ref>

==Modified analogs==

[[Iododeoxyuridine]] is a radiosensitizer and increases the amount of DNA damage received from ionizing radiation.

[[Zidovudine|Azidothymidine]] (AZT) – used in the treatment of [[HIV]] infection.  AZT [[Reverse transcriptase inhibitor|inhibits the process of reverse transcription]], a critical step in the [[HIV#Replication cycle|viral life cycle]].

[[Radioactive tracer|Radiolabeled]] thymidine (TdR), such as [[tritium|tritiated]] thymidine (<sup>3</sup>H-TdR), is commonly used in cell proliferation assays. The thymidine is incorporated into dividing cells and the level of this incorporation, measured using a [[Scintillation counter|liquid scintillation counter]], is proportional to the amount of cell proliferation. For example, [[lymphocyte]] proliferation can be measured this way in [[lymphoproliferative disorders]].

[[Bromodeoxyuridine]] (BrdU) is another thymidine analog that is often used for the detection of proliferating cells in living tissues.

[[5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine|5-Ethynyl-2´-deoxyuridine]] (EdU) is a thymidine analog which is incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells and is used to assay DNA synthesis in cell culture or living tissues. It can be visualized by covalently binding a fluorescent azide using [[click chemistry]], which is less harsh than the conditions used to expose the [[epitope]] for BrdU antibodies.

[[Edoxudine]] is an [[antiviral drug]].

'''Dobutamine''' is a [[sympathomimetic]] [[drug]] used in the treatment of [[heart failure]] and [[cardiogenic shock]]. Its primary mechanism is direct stimulation of [[beta receptor|β<sub>1</sub> receptors]] of the [[sympathetic nervous system]]. Dobutamine was developed in the 1970s by Drs. Ronald Tuttle and Jack Mills at [[Eli Lilly and Company]], as a [[analog (chemistry)|structural analogue]] of [[isoprenaline]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tuttle RR, Mills J |title=Dobutamine: development of a new catecholamine to selectively increase cardiac contractility |journal=Circ Res |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=185–96 |date=January 1975 |pmid=234805 |url=http://circres.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/36/1/185 |doi=10.1161/01.RES.36.1.185}}</ref>

==Clinical uses==
Dobutamine is used to treat acute but potentially reversible [[heart failure]], such as which occurs during [[cardiac surgery]] or in cases of [[Septic shock|septic]] or cardiogenic shock, on the basis of its positive [[inotrope|inotropic]] action.<ref name="rang">{{cite book |vauthors=Rang HP, Dale MM, Ritter JM, Flower RJ |title=Rang and Dale's Pharmacology}}</ref>

Dobutamine can be used in cases of [[congestive heart failure]] to increase cardiac output. It is indicated when [[Total parenteral nutrition|parenteral therapy]] is necessary for inotropic support in the short-term treatment of patients with cardiac [[decompensation]] due to depressed [[contractility]], which could be the result of either organic heart disease or cardiac surgical procedures. It is not useful in [[ischemic heart disease]] because it increases heart rate and thus increases myocardial oxygen demand.{{Citation needed|reason=cursory web search indicates that dobutamine is not chronotropic at standard doses|date=September 2016}}

The drug is also commonly used in the hospital setting as a pharmacologic stress testing agent to identify coronary artery disease.

==Adverse effects==

Primary side effects include those commonly seen for β<sub>1</sub> active sympathomimetics, such as [[hypertension]], [[angina]], [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]], and [[tachycardia]]. Used with caution in atrial fibrillation as it has the effect of increasing the atrioventricular (AV) conduction.<ref name=pharmnemonics>{{Cite book | author=Shen, Howard | title=Illustrated Pharmacology Memory Cards: PharMnemonics | year=2008 | publisher=Minireview | isbn=1-59541-101-1 | page=6}}</ref>

The most dangerous side effect of dobutamine is increased risk of arrhythmia, including fatal arrhythmias.

==Pharmacology==
Dobutamine is a direct-acting agent whose primary activity results from stimulation of the [[beta-1 adrenoceptor|β<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors]] of the heart, increasing contractility and cardiac output.  Since it does not act on [[dopamine receptor]]s to induce the release of [[norepinephrine]] (another? α<sub>1</sub> agonist), dobutamine is less prone to induce hypertension than is [[dopamine]].

Dobutamine is predominantly a [[beta-1 agonist|β<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic agonist]], with weak β<sub>2</sub> activity, and [[alpha-1 receptor|α<sub>1</sub>]] selective activity, although it is used clinically in cases of cardiogenic shock for its β<sub>1</sub> [[inotropic]] effect in increasing heart contractility and cardiac output.

===Depression===
The effectiveness of fluoxetine and other [[antidepressant]]s in the treatment of mild-to-moderate [[major depressive disorder|depression]] is controversial. A [[meta-analysis]] published by Kirsch in 2008 suggests, in those with mild or moderate symptoms, the efficacy of fluoxetine and other SSRIs is clinically insignificant.<ref name=KIRSCH2008>{{cite journal|last=Kirsch|first=Irving|title=Initial Severity and Antidepressant Benefits: A Meta-Analysis of Data Submitted to the Food and Drug Administration|publisher=PLoS Med|pmc=2253608|year=2008|last2=Deacon|first2=BJ|last3=Huedo-Medina|first3=TB|last4=Scoboria|first4=A|last5=Moore|first5=TJ|last6=Johnson|first6=BT|volume=5|issue=2|pages=e45|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050045|journal=PLoS Medicine|pmid=18303940}}</ref> A 2009 meta-analysis by Fournier which evaluated patient-level data from six trials of the SSRI [[paroxetine]] and the non-SSRI antidepressant [[imipramine]] has been further cited as evidence that antidepressants exhibit minimal efficacy in mild to moderate depression.<ref name=JAMA2010>{{cite journal|author1=Jay C.

A 2009 systematic review by the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence|National Institute of Care and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) (which considered the Kirsch, but not the later meta-analyses) concluded strong evidence existed for the efficacy of SSRIs in the treatment of moderate and severe depression, with some evidence for their efficacy in the treatment of mild depression.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG90/Guidance/pdf/English|title=CG90 Depression in adults: full guidance|format=PDF|work=[[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]]|accessdate=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109171623/http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG90/Guidance/pdf/English|archivedate=9 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  Both the NICE and the Fournier analyses concluded that greater evidence is seen for the efficacy of antidepressants in the treatment of chronic mild depression ([[dysthymia]]) than in recent-onset mild depression.

NICE recommends antidepressant treatment with an SSRI in combination with psychosocial interventions as second-line treatment for short term mild depression, and as a first line treatment for severe and moderate depression, as well as mild depression that is recurrent or long-standing. The [[American Psychiatric Association]] includes antidepressant therapy among its first-line options for the treatment of depression, particularly when  "a history of prior positive response to antidepressant medications, the presence of moderate to severe symptoms, significant sleep or appetite disturbances, agitation, patient preference, and anticipation of the need for maintenance therapy" exist.<ref>[http://psychiatryonline.org/content.aspx?bookID=28&sectionID=1667485#654260 ]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

However, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 21 studies – published in the ''Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada'' – concluded, "the apparent increased risk of fetal cardiac malformations associated with maternal use of fluoxetine has recently been shown also in depressed women who deferred SSRI therapy in pregnancy, and therefore most probably reflects an ascertainment bias.

Per the [[FDA]], infants exposed to [[SSRI]]s in late pregnancy may have an increased risk for [[Persistent fetal circulation|persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn]]. Limited data support this risk, but the FDA recommends physicians consider tapering SSRIs such as fluoxetine during the third trimester.<ref name=ProzacLabel2014/> A 2009 review recommended against fluoxetine as a first-line SSRI during lactation, stating, "[fluoxetine] should be viewed as a less-preferred SSRI for breastfeeding mothers, particularly with newborn infants, and in those mothers who consumed fluoxetine during gestation."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jhl.sagepub.com/content/26/2/187.full.pdf+html |title=Review: The Use of Antidepressants in Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women: A Review of Recent Studies |website=Jhl.sagepub.com |accessdate=2017-03-03}}</ref>  [[Sertraline]] is often the preferred SSRI during pregnancy due to the relatively minimal fetal exposure observed and its safety profile while breastfeeding.<ref name="Maudsley">{{cite book|isbn=978-0-470-97948-8|title=The Maudsley prescribing guidelines in psychiatry|last1=Taylor|first1=D|author2=Paton, C; Shitij, K|year=2012|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=West Sussex|pages= }}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Side effects observed in fluoxetine-treated persons in clinical trial with an incidence >5% and at least twice as common in fluoxetine-treated persons compared to those who received a placebo pill include abnormal  dreams, abnormal ejaculation, anorexia, anxiety, asthenia, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flu syndrome, impotence, insomnia, decreased libido, nausea, nervousness, pharyngitis, rash, sinusitis, somnolence, sweating, tremor, vasodilatation, and yawning.<ref name = pkginsert>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Bland RD, Clarke TL, Harden LB, etal |title=Rapid infusion of sodium bicarbonate and albumin into high-risk premature infants soon after birth: a controlled, prospective trial |journal=Am.

===Sexual dysfunction===
{{See also|Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor#Sexual dysfunction}}
Sexual dysfunction, including loss of libido, anorgasmia, lack of vaginal lubrication, and erectile dysfunction, are some of the most commonly encountered adverse effects of treatment with fluoxetine and other SSRIs. While early clinical trials suggested a relatively low rate of sexual dysfunction, more recent studies in which the investigator actively inquires about sexual problems suggest that the incidence is >70%.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Clark MS, Jansen K, Bresnahan M |title=Clinical inquiry: How do antidepressants affect sexual function? |journal=J Fam Pract |volume=62 |issue=11 |pages=660–1 |date=November 2013  |pmid=24288712 |doi= |url=}}</ref>  Symptoms of sexual dysfunction have been reported to persist after discontinuing SSRIs, although this is thought to be occasional.<ref name=ProzacLabel2014/><ref name=Csoka2008>{{cite journal |vauthors=Csoka AB, Csoka A, Bahrick A, Mehtonen OP | title = Persistent sexual dysfunction after discontinuation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors | journal = The Journal of Sexual Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 227–33 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18173768 | doi = 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00630.x }}</ref><ref name=Csoka2006>{{cite journal |vauthors=Csoka AB, Shipko S | title = Persistent sexual side effects after SSRI discontinuation | journal = Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 187–8 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16636635 | doi = 10.1159/000091777 | url = http://www.mediafire.com/view/hn31cmg4n28bq3x/06_pssd_Csoka.pdf | accessdate = 30 January 2014 }}</ref>

===Discontinuation syndrome===
[[Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome]] is an adverse effect of second generation anti-depressants, including fluoxetine. The symptoms appear with rapid discontinuation of one of these drugs, and can include dizziness, disturbance of balance, headache, nausea, insomnia, and vivid dreams. Others can include [[paraesthesia|sensations of tingling or numbness]], ‘electric-shock’-like sensations, and irritability, with some case reports of hallucinations.  They can generally be prevented by tapering off the drug over a period of four weeks, although evidence is weak for optimal tapering and there is disagreement between experts over the schedule. If a person is informed of the risk of discontinuation syndrome prior to starting the drug and again prior to beginning any tapering, discontinuation symptoms appear to be fewer and less severe, but again evidence is weak. Slower-acting drugs, like fluoxetine, may be less likely to cause discontinuation symptoms, but the evidence for this is weak as well. The mechanism by which discontinuation syndrome occurs in some people is not well understood.<ref name=Wilson2015rev>{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=E|last2=Lader|first2=M|title=A review of the management of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms.|journal=Therapeutic advances in psychopharmacology|date=December 2015|volume=5|issue=6|pages=357–68|pmid=26834969|pmc=4722507|doi=10.1177/2045125315612334}}</ref>

There is less data on fluoxetine than on antidepressants as a whole. For the above analysis on the antidepressant level, the FDA had to combine the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants for psychiatric indications to obtain [[statistically significant]] results.

==Interactions==
Contraindications include prior treatment (within the past two weeks) with [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors|MAOI]]s such as [[phenelzine]] and [[tranylcypromine]], due to the potential for [[serotonin syndrome]].<ref name = TGA/> Its use should also be avoided in those with known hypersensitivities to fluoxetine or any of the other ingredients in the formulation used.<ref name = TGA/> Its use in those concurrently receiving [[pimozide]] or [[thioridazine]] is also advised against.<ref name = TGA/>

In some cases, use of [[dextromethorphan]]-containing cold & cough medications with fluoxetine is advised against, due to fluoxetine increasing serotonin levels, as well as  the fact that fluoxetine is a cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor, which causes dextromethorphan to not be metabolized at a normal rate, thus increasing the risk of serotonin syndrome and other potential side effects of dextromethorphan.<ref name="Drugs.com 1">{{cite web |url=https://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/dextromethorphan-with-fluoxetine-844-0-1115-0.html |title=Dextromethorphan and fluoxetine Drug Interactions |website=Drugs.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814134442/https://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/dextromethorphan-with-fluoxetine-844-0-1115-0.html |archivedate=14 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

=== Pharmacodynamics ===
Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and does not appreciably inhibit [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]] reuptake at therapeutic doses. It does, however, delay the reuptake of serotonin, resulting in serotonin persisting longer when it is released. Large doses in rats have been shown to induce a significant increase in synaptic norepinephrine and dopamine.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01285563 |title=Fluoxetine increases norepinephrine release in rat hypothalamus as measured by tissue levels of MHPG-SO4 and microdialysis in conscious rats|year=1997 |last1=Perry |first1=K.

The extremely slow elimination of fluoxetine and its active metabolite norfluoxetine from the body distinguishes it from other antidepressants. With time, fluoxetine and norfluoxetine inhibit their own metabolism, so fluoxetine [[elimination half-life]] changes from 1 to 3&nbsp;days, after a single dose, to 4 to 6&nbsp;days, after long-term use.<ref name = TGA/> Similarly, the half-life of norfluoxetine is longer (16&nbsp;days) after long-term use.<ref name="RxList"/><ref name="pmid10917403">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00004714-200008000-00006|title=Weekly Dosing of Fluoxetine for the Continuation Phase of Treatment of Major Depression: Results of a Placebo-Controlled, Randomized Clinical Trial |year=2000 |last1=Burke |first1=William J. |last2=Hendricks |first2=Shelton E. |last3=McArthur-Miller|first3=Delores |last4=Jacques |first4=Daniel |last5=Bessette |first5=Diane |last6=McKillup |first6=Tracy |last7=Stull |first7=Todd|last8=Wilson |first8=James |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=423–7 |pmid=10917403}}</ref><ref name="Newcastle">{{cite web |url = http://www.ncl.ac.uk/nnp/teaching/management/drugrx/antdep.html |title = Drug Treatments in Psychiatry: Antidepressants |year = 2005 |accessdate = April 14, 2007 |publisher = [[Newcastle University]] School of Neurology, Neurobiology and Psychiatry |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070417161229/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/nnp/teaching/management/drugrx/antdep.html |archivedate = 17 April 2007 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> Therefore, the concentration of the drug and its active metabolite in the blood continues to grow through the first few weeks of treatment, and their steady concentration in the blood is achieved only after four weeks.<ref name="pmid11199945">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00004714-200102000-00008 |title=Augmentation of Fluoxetine's Antidepressant Action by Pindolol: Analysis of Clinical, Pharmacokinetic, and Methodologic Factors |year=2001 |last1=Pérez |first1=Victor |last2=Puiigdemont|first2=Dolors |last3=Gilaberte |first3=Inmaculada |last4=Alvarez |first4=Enric |last5=Artigas |first5=Francesc |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology |volume=21 |pages=36–45 |pmid=11199945 |author6=Grup de Recerca en Trastorns Afectius |issue=1}}</ref><ref name="pmid12063152">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(00)00333-5 |title=Fluoxetine and norfluoxetine plasma concentrations during relapse-prevention treatment |year=2002 |last1=Brunswick |first1=David J. |last2=Amsterdam |first2=Jay D. |last3=Fawcett |first3=Jan|last4=Quitkin |first4=Frederic M. |last5=Reimherr |first5=Frederick W. |last6=Rosenbaum |first6=Jerrold F. |last7=Beasley Jr|first7=Charles M. |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=68 |issue=2–3 |pages=243–9 |pmid=12063152}}</ref> Moreover, the brain concentration of fluoxetine and its metabolites keeps increasing through at least the first five weeks of treatment.<ref name="pmid15886723">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1300749 |title=A Comparison of Brain and Serum Pharmacokinetics of R-Fluoxetine and Racemic Fluoxetine: A 19-F MRS Study |year=2005 |last1=Henry |first1=Michael E |last2=Schmidt |first2=Mark E |last3=Hennen|first3=John |last4=Villafuerte |first4=Rosemond A |last5=Butman |first5=Michelle L |last6=Tran |first6=Pierre |last7=Kerner |first7=Lynn T |last8=Cohen |first8=Bruce |last9=Renshaw |first9=Perry F  |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=30 |issue=8 |pages=1576–83|pmid=15886723}}</ref> That means that the full benefits of the current dose a patient receives are not realized for at least a month since its initiation.

===Measurement in body fluids===
Fluoxetine and norfluoxetine may be quantitated in blood, plasma or serum to monitor therapy, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma fluoxetine concentrations are usually in a range of 50–500&nbsp;μg/L in persons taking the drug for its antidepressant effects, 900–3000 μg/L in survivors of acute overdosage and 1000–7000&nbsp;μg/L in victims of fatal overdosage. Norfluoxetine concentrations are approximately equal to those of the parent drug during chronic therapy, but may be substantially less following acute overdosage, since it requires at least 1–2 weeks for the metabolite to achieve equilibrium.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=3871765 |year=1985 |last1=Lemberger |first1=L |last2=Bergstrom |first2=RF |last3=Wolen |first3=RL|last4=Farid |first4=NA |last5=Enas |first5=GG |last6=Aronoff |first6=GR |title=Fluoxetine: Clinical pharmacology and physiologic disposition |volume=46 |issue=3 Pt 2 |pages=14–9 |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1741813|year=1991 |last1=Pato |first1=MT |last2=Murphy |first2=DL |last3=Devane |first3=CL |title=Sustained plasma concentrations of fluoxetine and/or norfluoxetine four and eight weeks after fluoxetine discontinuation |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=224–5 |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology |doi=10.1097/00004714-199106000-00024}}</ref><ref>R.

==History==

The work which eventually led to the discovery of fluoxetine began at Eli Lilly and Company in 1970 as a collaboration between [[Bryan Molloy]] and Robert Rathbun. It was known at that time that the [[antihistamine]] [[diphenhydramine]] shows some antidepressant-like properties. 3-Phenoxy-3-phenylpropylamine, a compound structurally similar to diphenhydramine, was taken as a starting point, and Molloy synthesized dozens of its derivatives.<ref name=Wong>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0024-3205(95)00209-O |title=Prozac (fluoxetine, lilly 110140), the first selective serotonin uptake inhibitor and an antidepressant drug: Twenty years since its first publication |year=1995 |last1=Wong |first1=David T. |last2=Bymaster |first2=Frank P. |last3=Engleman |first3=Eric A. |journal=Life Sciences |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=411–41 |pmid=7623609}}</ref>  Hoping to find a derivative inhibiting only [[serotonin]] reuptake, an Eli Lilly scientist, [[David T.

'''Ceruletide''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), also known as '''cerulein''' or '''caerulein''', is a ten amino acid [[oligopeptide]] that stimulates [[smooth muscle]] and increases digestive secretions.  Ceruletide is similar in action and composition to [[cholecystokinin]]. It stimulates gastric, biliary, and pancreatic secretion; and certain smooth muscle. It is used in paralytic ileus and as diagnostic aid in pancreatic malfunction.  It is used to induce [[pancreatitis]] in experimental animal models.

[[Image:Hyla caerula Korallen-Laubfrosch.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The tree frog ''Litoria caerulae'', formerly named ''Hyla caerulae''.]]
Ceruletide was discovered and its structure elucidated in 1967 by Australian and Italian scientists from dried skins of the [[Australian green tree frog]] (''Litoria caerulea'', formerly ''Hyla caerulea'').  Its amino acid sequence is Pglu-Gln-Asp-Tyr[SO<sub>3</sub>H]-Thr-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH<sub>2</sub>.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02154119 |author1=A. Anastasi |author2=V.

[[File:Effects of CCK on the gastrointestinal tract.svg|thumb|Effects of cholecystokinin on the gastrointestinal tract. Cholecystokinin is secreted by I-cells in the small intestine and induces contraction of the gallbladder, relaxes the sphincter of Oddi, reduces of gastric acid secretion, increases bile acid production in the liver, delays gastric emptying, and induces digestive enzyme production in the pancreas.]]
'''Cholecystokinin''' ('''CCK''' or '''CCK-PZ'''; from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''chole'', "bile"; ''cysto'', "sac"; ''kinin'', "move"; hence, ''move the bile-sac ([[gallbladder]])'') is a [[peptide hormone]] of the [[gastrointestinal system]] responsible for stimulating the [[digestion]] of [[fat]] and [[protein]]. Cholecystokinin, previously called '''''pancreozymin''''', is synthesized and secreted by [[enteroendocrine cell]]s in the [[duodenum]], the first segment of the [[small intestine]]. Its presence causes the release of [[digestive enzymes]] and [[bile]] from the [[pancreas]] and [[gallbladder]], respectively, and also acts as a [[appetite suppressant|hunger suppressant]].<ref name = "Johnson_2014">{{cite book | last1 = Johnson | first1 = Leonard R. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Gastrointestinal Physiology | date = 2013 | isbn = 978-0-323-10085-4 | edition = Eighth | publisher = Elsevier/Mosby | location = Philadelphia }}</ref><ref name="urlCholecystokinin">{{cite web | url = http://arbl.cvmbs.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/gi/cck.html | title = Cholecystokinin | date = 28 January 2001 | publisher = Colorado State University | vauthors = Bowen R | accessdate = 6 November 2015 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160317024952/http://arbl.cvmbs.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/gi/cck.html | archivedate = 17 March 2016 | df = dmy-all }} </ref>

==Structure==
The existence of CCK was first suggested in 1905 by the British physiologist Joy Simcha Cohen. It is a member of the gastrin/cholecystokinin family of peptide hormones and is very similar in structure to [[gastrin]], another [[gastrointestinal hormone]]. CCK and gastrin share the same five C-terminal amino acids. CCK is composed of varying numbers of [[amino acid]]s depending on [[post-translational modification]] of the 150-amino acid precursor, preprocholecystokinin.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chaudhri O, Small C, Bloom S | title = Gastrointestinal hormones regulating appetite | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences | volume = 361 | issue = 1471 | pages = 1187–209 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16815798 | pmc = 1642697 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2006.1856  }}</ref> Thus, the CCK peptide hormone exists in several forms, each identified by the number of amino acids it contains, e.g., CCK58, CCK33, CCK22 and CCK8. CCK58 assumes a [[helix-turn-helix]] configuration.<ref name="pmid8967499">{{cite journal | vauthors = Reeve JR, Eysselein VE, Rosenquist G, Zeeh J, Regner U, Ho FJ, Chew P, Davis MT, Lee TD, Shively JE, Brazer SR, Liddle RA | title = Evidence that CCK-58 has structure that influences its biological activity | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 270 | issue = 5 Pt 1 | pages = G860-8 | date = May 1996 | pmid = 8967499 }}</ref> Biological activity resides in the C-terminus of the peptide. Most CCK peptides have a sulfate-group attached to a tyrosine located seven residues from the C-terminus.<ref name=":0" /> This modification is crucial for the ability of CCK to activate the [[cholecystokinin A receptor]]. Nonsulfated CCK peptides also occur, which consequently cannot activate the CCK-A receptor.<ref name="PMID 24734780">{{cite journal | vauthors = Agersnap M, Rehfeld JF | title = Measurement of nonsulfated cholecystokinins | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Clinical and Laboratory Investigation | volume = 74 | issue = 5 | pages = 424–31 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24734780 | doi = 10.3109/00365513.2014.900695 }}</ref>

== Function ==
CCK plays important physiologic roles both as a neuropeptide in the [[central nervous system]] and as a peptide hormone in the gut.<ref name="Lenka_2016">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lenka A, Arumugham SS, Christopher R, Pal PK | title = Genetic substrates of psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease: A critical review | journal = Journal of the Neurological Sciences | volume = 364 | pages = 33–41 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27084212 | doi = 10.1016/j.jns.2016.03.005  }}</ref> It participates in a number of [[Physiology|physiological]] processes such as digestion, [[Hunger (motivational state)|satiety]] and [[anxiety]].<nowiki/>

=== Gastrointestinal ===

CCK is synthesized and released by enteroendocrine cells in the mucosal lining of the small intestine (mostly in the duodenum and jejunum), called [[Enteroendocrine cell#Intestinal enteroendocrine cells|I cells]], neurons of the [[enteric nervous system]], and neurons in the brain.<ref name="Johnson_2014" /> It is released rapidly into the circulation in response to a meal. The greatest stimulator of CCK release is the presence of [[fatty acid]]<nowiki/>s and/or certain [[amino acid]]s in the [[chyme]] entering the [[duodenum]].<ref name=":0" />  In addition, release of CCK is stimulated by [[monitor peptide]] (released by pancreatic [[Centroacinar cell|acinar cells]]), [[CCK-releasing protein]] (via [[paracrine signalling]] mediated by [[enterocyte]]s in the [[Gastric mucosa|gastric]] and [[Human gastrointestinal tract#Mucosa|intestinal mucosa]]), and [[acetylcholine]] (released by the [[Parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic nerve]] fibers of the [[vagus nerve]]).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chey WY, Chang T | title = Neural hormonal regulation of exocrine pancreatic secretion | journal = Pancreatology | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 320–35 | date = 2001-01-01 | pmid = 12120211  }}</ref>

Once in the circulatory system, CCK has a relatively short half-life.<ref name="Skibicka_2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Skibicka KP, Dickson SL | title = Enteroendocrine hormones - central effects on behavior | journal = Current Opinion in Pharmacology | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 977–82 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24091195 | doi = 10.1016/j.coph.2013.09.004  }}</ref>

==== Digestion ====
CCK mediates digestion in the small intestine by inhibiting gastric emptying.  It stimulates the [[Centroacinar cells|acinar cells]] of the [[pancreas]] to release a juice rich in pancreatic [[digestive enzymes]] (hence an alternate name, ''pancreozymin'') that catalyze the digestion of fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Thus, as the levels of the substances that stimulated the release of CCK drop, the concentration of the hormone drops as well. The release of CCK is also inhibited by [[somatostatin]] and pancreatic peptide. Trypsin, a protease released by pancreatic acinar cells, hydrolyzes CCK-releasing peptide and monitor peptide, in effect turning off the additional signals to secrete CCK.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Liddle RA | title = Regulation of cholecystokinin secretion by intraluminal releasing factors | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 269 | issue = 3 Pt 1 | pages = G319-27 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 7573441 }}</ref>

CCK also causes the increased production of hepatic bile, and stimulates the contraction of the [[gall bladder]] and the relaxation of the [[sphincter of Oddi]] (Glisson's sphincter), resulting in the delivery of [[bile]] into the duodenal part of the small intestine.<ref name="Johnson_2014" /><ref name="urlCholecystokinin" /> [[Bile salt]]s form [[amphiphile|amphipathic]] [[lipids]], [[micelle]]s that [[emulsification|emulsify]] fats, aiding in their digestion and absorption.<ref name="Johnson_2014" />

==== Satiety ====
As a peptide hormone, CCK mediates satiety by acting on the [[CCK receptor]]s distributed widely throughout the [[central nervous system]]. The mechanism for hunger suppression is thought to be a decrease in the rate of gastric emptying.<ref name="pmid3812772">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shillabeer G, Davison JS | title = Proglumide, a cholecystokinin antagonist, increases gastric emptying in rats | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 252 | issue = 2 Pt 2 | pages = R353-60 | date = February 1987 | pmid = 3812772 | url = http://ajpregu.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/252/2/R353 }}</ref> CCK also has stimulatory effects on the [[vagus nerve]], effects that can be inhibited by [[capsaicin]].<ref name="pmid9655678">{{cite journal | vauthors = Holzer P | title = Neural injury, repair, and adaptation in the GI tract.

The effects of CCK vary between individuals. For example, in [[rat]]s, CCK administration significantly reduces hunger in adult males, but is slightly less effective in younger subjects, and even slightly less effective in females. The hunger-suppressive effects of CCK also are reduced in obese rats.<ref name="pmid9835394">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fink H, Rex A, Voits M, Voigt JP | title = Major biological actions of CCK--a critical evaluation of research findings | journal = Experimental Brain Research | volume = 123 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 77–83 | date = November 1998 | pmid = 9835394 | doi = 10.1007/s002210050546 }}</ref>

=== Neurological ===

CCK is found extensively throughout the [[central nervous system]], with high concentrations found in the [[limbic system]].<ref name="Bowers_2012">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bowers ME, Choi DC, Ressler KJ | title = Neuropeptide regulation of fear and anxiety: Implications of cholecystokinin, endogenous opioids, and neuropeptide Y | journal = Physiology & Behavior | volume = 107 | issue = 5 | pages = 699–710 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 22429904 | doi = 10.1016/j.physbeh.2012.03.004 | pmc = 3532931 }}</ref> CCK is synthesized as a 115 amino acid [[preprohormone]], that is then converted into multiple [[Protein isoform|isoforms]].<ref name="Bowers_2012" /> The predominant form of CCK in the central nervous system is the [[Tyrosine sulfation|sulfated]] [[Peptide|octapeptide]], CCK-8S.<ref name="Bowers_2012" />

==== Anxiogenic ====
In both humans and rodents, studies clearly indicate that elevated CCK levels causes increased [[anxiety]].<ref name="Skibicka_2013" /> The site of the anxiety-inducing effects of CCK seems to be central with specific targets being the [[basolateral amygdala]], [[hippocampus]], [[hypothalamus]], [[Periaqueductal gray|peraqueductal grey]], and [[Cerebral cortex|cortical regions]].<ref name="Skibicka_2013" /><ref name="Zwanzger_2012">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zwanzger P, Domschke K, Bradwejn J | title = Neuronal network of panic disorder: the role of the neuropeptide cholecystokinin | journal = Depression and Anxiety | volume = 29 | issue = 9 | pages = 762–74 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22553078 | doi = 10.1002/da.21919  }}</ref>

==== Panicogenic ====
The CCK tetrapeptide fragment [[CCK-4]] ([[Tryptophan|Trp]]-[[Methionine|Met]]-[[Aspartate|Asp]]-[[Phenylalanine|Phe]]-NH<sub>2</sub>) reliably causes anxiety and [[panic attack]]s (panicogenic effect) when administered to humans and is commonly used in scientific research for this purpose of in order to test new [[anxiolytic]] drugs.<ref name="Zwanzger_2012" /><ref name="pmid8104032">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bradwejn J | title = Neurobiological investigations into the role of cholecystokinin in panic disorder | journal = Journal of Psychiatry & Neuroscience | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 178–88 | date = July 1993 | pmid = 8104032 | pmc = 1188527 | doi =  }}</ref> [[Positron emission tomography]] visualization of regional cerebral blood flow in patients undergoing CCK-4 induced panic attacks show changes in the [[Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate gyrus]], the [[claustrum]]-[[Insular cortex|insular]]-[[amygdala]] region, and [[cerebellar vermis]].<ref name="Bowers_2012" />

==== Hallucinogenic ====
Several studies have implicated CCK as a cause of [[Hallucination|visual hallucinations]] in [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson’s disease]]. Mutations in CCK receptors in combination with mutated CCK genes potentiate this association. These studies also uncovered potential racial/ethnic differences in the distribution of mutated CCK genes.<ref name="Lenka_2016" />

== Interactions ==

CCK has been shown to [[Protein-protein interaction|interact]] with the Cholecystokinin A receptor located mainly on pancreatic acinar cells and [[Cholecystokinin B receptor]] mostly in the brain and stomach.  CCK<sub>B</sub> receptor also binds gastrin, a gastrointestinal hormone involved in stimulating gastric acid release and growth of the gastric mucosa.<ref name="pmid15520004">{{cite journal | vauthors = Harikumar KG, Clain J, Pinon DI, Dong M, Miller LJ | title = Distinct molecular mechanisms for agonist peptide binding to types A and B cholecystokinin receptors demonstrated using fluorescence spectroscopy | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 280 | issue = 2 | pages = 1044–50 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15520004 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M409480200 }}</ref><ref name="pmid15001692">{{cite journal | vauthors = Aloj L, Caracò C, Panico M, Zannetti A, Del Vecchio S, Tesauro D, De Luca S, Arra C, Pedone C, Morelli G, Salvatore M | title = In vitro and in vivo evaluation of 111In-DTPAGlu-G-CCK8 for cholecystokinin-B receptor imaging | journal = Journal of Nuclear Medicine | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 485–94 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15001692 | doi =  }}</ref><ref name="pmid12695525">{{cite journal | vauthors = Galés C, Poirot M, Taillefer J, Maigret B, Martinez J, Moroder L, Escrieut C, Pradayrol L, Fourmy D, Silvente-Poirot S | title = Identification of tyrosine 189 and asparagine 358 of the cholecystokinin 2 receptor in direct interaction with the crucial C-terminal amide of cholecystokinin by molecular modeling, site-directed mutagenesis, and structure/affinity studies | journal = Molecular Pharmacology | volume = 63 | issue = 5 | pages = 973–82 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12695525 | doi = 10.1124/mol.63.5.973 }}</ref> CCK has also been shown to interact with [[calcineurin]] in the pancreas.

! Summary
|-
|Haloperidol often causes troublesome adverse effects. If there is no other antipsychotic drug, using haloperidol to offset the consequences of untreated schizophrenia is justified. Where a choice of drug is available, however, an alternative [[antipsychotic]] with less likelihood of adverse effects such as parkinsonism, akathisia and acute dystonias may be more desirable.<ref name=Ada2013 />

=== Pregnancy and lactation ===

Data from [[Animal testing|animal experiments]] indicate haloperidol is not [[teratogenic]], but is embryotoxic in high doses.  In humans, no controlled studies exist.  Reports in pregnant women revealed possible damage to the fetus, although most of the women were exposed to multiple drugs during pregnancy. In addition,  reports indicate neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery, such as agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder. Following accepted general principles, haloperidol should be given during pregnancy only if the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential fetal risk.<ref name="FDA">{{cite web |url = https://www.drugs.com/pro/haldol.html |title = Haldol Official FDA information, side effects and uses |publisher = Drugs.com |accessdate = 2013-10-03 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131005001049/http://www.drugs.com/pro/haldol.html |archivedate = 2013-10-05 |df = }}</ref>

Haloperidol, when given to lactating women, is found in significant amounts in their milk. Breastfed children sometimes show [[extrapyramidal symptoms]]. If the use of haloperidol during lactation seems indicated, the benefit for the mother should clearly outweigh the risk for the child, or breastfeeding should be stopped.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

During long-term treatment of chronic psychiatric disorders, the daily dose should be reduced to the lowest level needed for maintenance of remission.

Other forms of therapy (psychotherapy, occupational therapy/ergotherapy, or social rehabilitation) should be instituted properly.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}
PET imaging studies have suggested low doses are preferable. Clinical response was associated with at least 65% occupancy of D2 receptors, while greater than 72% was likely to cause hyperprolactinaemia and over 78% associated with extrapyramidal side effects.

The [[decanoate]] ester of haloperidol (haloperidol decanoate, trade names Haldol decanoate, Halomonth, Neoperidole) has a much longer duration of action, so is often used in people known to be noncompliant with oral medication. A dose is given by intramuscular injection once every two to four weeks.<ref>Goodman and Gilman's ''Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics'', 10th edition (McGraw-Hill, 2001).{{page needed|date=September 2012}}</ref> The [[IUPAC name]] of haloperidol decanoate is [4-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-oxobutyl]piperidin-4-yl] decanoate.

* Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis: analysis of 17 trials showed the risk of death in this group of patients was 1.6 to 1.7 times that of placebo-treated patients. Most of the causes of death were either cardiovascular or infectious in nature. It is not clear to what extent this observation is attributed to antipsychotic drugs rather than the characteristics of the patients. The drug bears a [[boxed warning]] about this risk.<ref name=FDA />
* Impaired [[liver]] function, as haloperidol is metabolized and eliminated mainly by the liver
* In patients with hyperthyreosis, the action of haloperidol is intensified and side effects are more likely.

* Other drugs metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme system: inducers such as [[carbamazepine]], [[phenobarbital]], and [[rifampicin]] decrease plasma levels and inhibitors such as [[quinidine]], [[buspirone]], and [[fluoxetine]] increase plasma levels<ref name=FDA />
* [[Tricyclic antidepressants]]:  metabolism and elimination of tricyclics significantly decreased, increased toxicity noted (anticholinergic and cardiovascular side effects, lowering of seizure threshold)

== Overdose ==

=== Symptoms ===

Symptoms are usually due to side effects. Most often encountered are:

* [[Anticholinergic]] side effects (dry mouth, constipation, paralytic [[ileus]], difficulties in urinating, decreased [[perspiration]])
* Coma in severe cases, accompanied by respiratory depression and massive hypotension, shock
* [[Hypotension]] or [[hypertension]]
* Rarely, serious ventricular arrhythmia (''torsades de pointes''), with or without prolonged [[QT-time]]
* [[Sedation]]
* Severe [[extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal]] side effects with muscle rigidity and tremors, [[akathisia]], etc.

=== Treatment ===

Treatment is merely symptomatic and involves intensive care with stabilization of vital functions. In early detected cases of oral overdose, induction of [[emesis]], [[gastric lavage]], and the use of [[activated charcoal]] can all be tried. [[Epinephrine]] is avoided for treatment of hypotension and shock, because its action might be reversed. In the case of a severe overdose, antidotes such as [[bromocriptine]] or [[ropinirole]] may be used to treat the extrapyramidal effects caused by haloperidol, acting as dopamine receptor agonists.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} ECG and vital signs should be monitored especially for QT prolongation and severe arrhythmias should be treated with antiarrhythmic measures.<ref name=FDA />

=== Prognosis ===

In general, the prognosis of overdose is good, and lasting damage is not known, provided the person has survived the initial phase. An overdose of haloperidol can be fatal.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.drugs.com/mtm/haloperidol.html |title = Haloperidol at Drugs.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111122170902/http://www.drugs.com/mtm/haloperidol.html |archivedate = 2011-11-22 |df = }}</ref>

== Pharmacokinetics ==

=== By mouth ===

The bioavailability of oral haloperidol ranges from 60–70%. However, there is a wide variance in reported mean [[Cmax (pharmacology)|T<sub>max</sub>]] and [[Biological half-life|T<sub>1/2</sub>]] in different studies, ranging from 1.7 to 6.1 hours and 14.5 to 36.7 hours respectively.<ref name=PK1999 />

=== Intramuscular injections ===

The drug is well and rapidly absorbed with a high bioavailability when injected intramuscularly. The T<sub>max</sub> is 20 minutes in healthy individuals and 33.8 minutes in patients with schizophrenia. The mean T<sub>1/2</sub> is 20.7 hours.<ref name=PK1999 /> The [[decanoate]] injectable formulation is for intramuscular administration only and is not intended to be used intravenously. The plasma concentrations of haloperidol decanoate reach a peak at about six days after the injection, falling thereafter, with an approximate half-life of three weeks.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.drugs.com/pro/haldol-decanoate.html |title = drugs.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110810064415/http://www.drugs.com/pro/haldol-decanoate.html |archivedate = 2011-08-10 |df = }}</ref>

=== Intravenous injections ===

The bioavailability is 100% in intravenous (IV) injection, and the very rapid onset of action is seen within seconds. The T<sub>1/2</sub> is 14.1 to 26.2 hours. The apparent volume of distribution is between 9.5 and 21.7 L/kg.<ref name=PK1999 />  The duration of action is four to six hours. If haloperidol is given as a slow IV infusion, the onset of action is slowed, and the duration of action is prolonged.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[File:Haloperidol (Haldol).jpg|thumb|Haloperidol for injection]]

=== Therapeutic concentrations ===

Plasma levels of four to 25 micrograms per liter are required for therapeutic action. The determination of plasma levels can be used to calculate dose adjustments and to check compliance, particularly in long-term patients. Plasma levels in excess of the therapeutic range may lead to a higher incidence of side effects or even pose the risk of haloperidol intoxication.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The concentration of haloperidol in brain tissue is about 20-fold higher compared to blood levels. It is slowly eliminated from brain tissue,<ref name="Kornhuber1999">{{cite journal |first1 = Johannes |last1 = Kornhuber |first2 = Andreas |last2 = Schultz |first3 = Jens |last3 = Wiltfang |first4 = Ingolf |last4 = Meineke |first5 = Christoph H. |last5 = Gleiter |first6 = Robert |last6 = Zöchling |first7 = Karl-Werner |last7 = Boissl |first8 = Friedrich |last8 = Leblhuber |first9 = Peter |last9 = Riederer |year = 1999 |title = Persistence of Haloperidol in Human Brain Tissue |journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume = 156 |issue = 6 |pages = 885–90 |url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=156&page=885 |pmid = 10360127 |doi = 10.1176/ajp.156.6.885 }}</ref>  which may explain the slow disappearance of side effects when the medication is stopped.<ref name="Kornhuber1999" /><ref>{{cite journal |first1 = Johannes |last1 = Kornhuber |first2 = Jens |last2 = Wiltfang |first3 = Peter |last3 = Riederer |first4 = Stefan |last4 = Bleich |year = 2006 |title = Neuroleptic drugs in the human brain: Clinical impact of persistence and region-specific distribution |journal = European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience |volume = 256 |issue = 5 |pages = 274–80 |pmid = 16788768 |doi = 10.1007/s00406-006-0661-7 }}</ref>

=== Distribution and metabolism ===

Haloperidol is heavily protein bound in human plasma, with a free fraction of only 7.5 to 11.6%. It is also extensively metabolized in the liver with only about 1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. The greatest proportion of the hepatic clearance is by glucuronidation, followed by reduction and CYP-mediated oxidation, primarily by [[CYP3A4]].<ref name=PK1999 />

== History ==

Haloperidol was discovered by [[Paul Janssen]].<ref>{{cite book |last = Healy |first = David |authorlink = David Healy (psychiatrist) |title = The psychopharmacologists |volume = 1 |year = 1996 |publisher = Chapman and Hall |location = London |isbn = 978-1-86036-008-4 }}{{page needed|date=September 2012}}</ref> It was developed in 1958 at the Belgian company [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]] and submitted to the first of clinical trials in [[Belgium]] later that year.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal |doi = 10.1080/10401230591002048 |title = The Haloperidol Story |year = 2005 |last1 = Granger |first1 = Bernard |last2 = Albu |first2 = Simona |journal = Annals of Clinical Psychiatry |volume = 17 |issue = 3 |pages = 137–40 |pmid = 16433054 }}</ref><ref name=JanssenHist>{{cite journal |last1 = Lopez-Munoz |first1 = Francisco |last2 = Alamo |first2 = Cecilio |title = The Consolidation of Neuroleptic Therapy: Janssen, the Discovery of Haloperidol and Its Introduction into Clinical Practice |journal = Brain Research Bulletin |date = 2009 |volume = 79 |pages = 130–141 |pmid = 19186209 |doi = 10.1016/j.brainresbull.2009.01.005 }}</ref>

Haloperidol was approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) on 12 April 1967; it was later marketed in the U.S. and other countries under the brand name Haldol by [[McNeil Laboratories]].<ref name=":0" />

=== Brand names ===

Haloperidol is the [[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]], [[Australian Approved Name|AAN]] approved name.

It is sold under the tradenames Aloperidin, Bioperidolo, Brotopon, Dozic, Duraperidol (Germany), Einalon S, Eukystol, Haldol (common tradename in the US and UK), Halosten, Keselan, Linton, Peluces, Serenace and Sigaperidol.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

== Veterinary use ==

Haloperidol is also used on many different kinds of animals. It appears to be particularly successful when given to birds, e.g., a parrot that will otherwise continuously [[Feather-plucking|pluck its feathers]] out.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.lcrx.com/veterinary_avian.html |title = Veterinary:Avian at Lloyd Center Pharmacy |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120426022957/http://www.lcrx.com/veterinary_avian.html |archivedate = 2012-04-26 |df = }}</ref>

'''Arbutin''' is a [[glycoside]]; a glycosylated [[hydroquinone]] extracted from the [[bearberry]] plant in the genus ''Arctostaphylos'' among many other medicinal plants, primarily in the [[Ericaceae]] family. Applied topically, it [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibits]] [[tyrosinase]] and thus prevents the formation of [[melanin]]. Arbutin is therefore used as a skin-lightening agent. Very tiny amounts of arbutin are found in [[wheat]], [[pear]] skins, and some other foods. It is also found in ''[[Bergenia crassifolia]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://notulaebotanicae.ro/nbha/article/viewFile/3108/2947 |title=Natural Resources Containing Arbutin.

== Skin lightening agent ==
Bearberry extract is used in skin lightening treatments designed for long term and regular use. An active agent in brands of skin lightening preparations, it is more expensive than traditional skin lightening ingredients like [[hydroquinone]], which is now banned in many countries. In vitro studies of human [[melanocytes]] exposed to arbutin at concentrations below 300 μg/mL reported decreased tyrosinase activity and melanin content with little evidence of cytotoxicity.<ref>[http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/files/Arbutin.pdf Arbutin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527233957/http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/files/Arbutin.pdf |date=May 27, 2010 }}, Supporting Nomination for Toxicological Evaluation by the National Toxicology Program</ref>

'''Ethanol''', also called '''alcohol''', '''ethyl alcohol''', and '''drinking alcohol''', is a [[chemical compound]], a simple [[alcohol]] with the [[chemical formula]] {{chem|C|2|H|5|OH}}. Its formula can be written also as {{chem|C|H|3}}−{{chem|C|H|2}}−{{chem|O|H}} or {{chem|C|2|H|5}}−{{chem|O|H}} (an [[ethyl group]] linked to a [[hydroxyl]] group), and is often abbreviated as '''EtOH'''. Ethanol is a [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]], [[flammability|flammable]], colorless liquid with a slight characteristic odor. It is a [[alcohol (drug)|psychoactive substance]] and is the principal type of alcohol found in [[alcoholic drink]]s.

Ethanol is naturally produced by the [[fermentation]] of [[sugar]]s by [[yeast]]s or via [[petrochemistry|petrochemical]] processes, and is most commonly consumed as a popular [[recreational drug]]. It also has medical applications as an [[antiseptic]] and [[disinfectant]]. The compound is widely used as a [[chemistry|chemical]] [[solvent]], either for scientific chemical testing or in [[chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of other [[organic compound]]s, and is a vital substance utilized across many different kinds of manufacturing industries. Ethanol is also used as a clean-burning [[alcohol fuel|fuel]] source.

==Etymology==
''Ethanol'' is the [[systematic name]] defined by the [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)]] for a compound consisting of [[alkyl group]] with two carbon [[atom]]s (prefix “eth-”), having a single bond between them (infix “-an-”), attached [[functional group]] −OH group (suffix “-ol”).<ref name="Pubchem">{{cite web|title = Ethanol – Compound Summary|url = https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=702|work = The PubChem Project|location = USA|publisher = National Center for Biotechnology Information}}</ref>

The “eth-” prefix and the qualifier “ethyl” in “ethyl alcohol” originally come from the name “ethyl” assigned in 1834 to the group {{chem|C|2|H|5}}− by [[Justus von Liebig|Justus Liebig]]. He coined the word from the [[German language|German]] name ''Aether'' of the compound {{chem|C|2|H|5}}−O−{{chem|C|2|H|5}} (commonly called “ether” in [[English language|English]], more specifically called “[[diethyl ether]]”).<ref>{{cite journal | last = Liebig | first = Justus | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1834 | title = Ueber die Constitution des Aethers und seiner Verbindungen | trans-title = On the constitution of ether and its compounds | language = German | doi = 10.1002/andp.18341072202 | journal = Annalen der Pharmacie | volume = 9 | pages = 1–39 | quote = From page 18: "''Bezeichnen wir die Kohlenwasserstoffverbindung 4C + 10H als das Radikal des Aethers mit E<sub>2</sub> und nennen es Ethyl'', ..." (Let us designate the hydrocarbon compound 4C + 10H as the radical of ether with E<sub>2</sub> and name it ethyl ...). }}</ref> According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], ''Ethyl'' is a contraction of the Ancient Greek [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B1%E1%BC%B0%CE%B8%CE%AE%CF%81#Ancient_Greek {{lang|grc|αἰθήρ}}] (''{{transl|grc|aithḗr}}'', “upper air”) and the Greek word [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BD%95%CE%BB%CE%B7#Ancient_Greek {{lang|grc|ὕλη}}] (''{{transl|grc|hýlē}}'', “substance”).<ref>{{OEtymD|ethyl}}</ref>

The name ''ethanol'' was coined as a result of a resolution that was adopted at the International Conference on Chemical Nomenclature that was held in April 1892 in Geneva, Switzerland.<ref>For a report on the 1892 International Conference on Chemical Nomenclature, see:
* {{cite journal| last = Armstrong | first = Henry | name-list-format = vanc |year=1892|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=LHkCAAAAIAAJ|page=56}} |title=The International Conference on Chemical Nomenclature|journal=Nature|volume=46|pages=56–59|doi=10.1038/046056c0|issue=1177|bibcode=1892Natur..46...56A}}
* Armstrong's report is reprinted with the resolutions in English in: {{cite journal| last = Armstrong | first = Henry | name-list-format = vanc |year=1892|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=RogMAQAAIAAJ|page=398}}|title=The International Conference on Chemical Nomenclature|journal=The Journal of Analytical and Applied Chemistry|volume=6|issue=|pages= 390–400 (398)|quote= The alcohols and the phenols will be called after the name of the hydrocarbon from which they are derived, terminated with the suffix ''ol'' (ex. pentanol, pentenol, etc.) }}</ref>

The term “[[alcohol]]” now refers to a wider class of substances in chemistry nomenclature, but in common parlance it remains the name of ethanol. The Oxford English Dictionary claims that it is a medieval loan from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''[[Kohl (cosmetics)|al-kuḥl]]'', a powdered ore of antimony used since antiquity as a cosmetic, and retained that meaning in [[Middle Latin]].<ref>[[OED]]; [[etymonline.com]]</ref> The use of “alcohol” for ethanol (in full, “alcohol of wine”) is modern, first recorded 1753, and by the later 17th century referred to “any sublimated substance; [[Distilled beverage|distilled spirit]]” use for “the spirit of wine” (shortened from a full expression ''alcohol of wine''). The systematic use in chemistry dates to 1850.

==Uses==

===Medical===
{{Main|Alcohol (medicine)}}

====Antiseptic====
Ethanol is used in medical wipes and most common antibacterial [[hand sanitizer]] gels as an [[antiseptic]]. Ethanol kills organisms by [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] their [[protein]]s and dissolving their [[lipid]]s and is effective against most [[bacteria]] and [[fungus|fungi]], and many [[virus]]es. However, ethanol is ineffective against bacterial [[Endospore|spores]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McDonnell G, Russell AD | title = Antiseptics and disinfectants: activity, action, and resistance | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 147–79 | date = January 1999 | pmid = 9880479 | pmc = 88911 }}</ref> 70% ethanol is the most effective concentration, particularly because of osmotic pressure.

====Rocket fuel====
Ethanol was commonly used as fuel in early [[bipropellant]] [[rocket]] (liquid propelled) vehicles, in conjunction with an [[oxidizer]] such as liquid oxygen. The German [[V-2 rocket]] of [[World War II]], credited with beginning the space age, used ethanol, mixed with 25% of water to reduce the combustion chamber temperature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/V/V-2.html|title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science: V-2| last = Darling | first = David | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref><ref name="braeunig">Braeunig, Robert A.

====Fuel cells====
Commercial fuel cells operate on reformed natural gas, [[hydrogen]] or [[methanol]]. Ethanol is an attractive alternative due to its wide availability, low cost, high purity and low toxicity. There are a wide range of fuel cell concepts that have been trialled including [[direct-ethanol fuel cell]]s, auto-thermal reforming systems and thermally integrated systems. The majority of work is being conducted at a research level although there are a number of organizations at the beginning of commercialization of ethanol fuel cells.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Badwal SP, Giddey S, Kulkarni A, Goel J, Basu S | title = Direct ethanol fuel cells for transport and stationary applications – A comprehensive review|journal=Applied Energy|date=May 2015|volume=145|pages=80–103|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.02.002}}</ref>

{{Further|<!-- Chemical derivatives of ethanol -->#Reactions}}

Ethanol is an important industrial ingredient. It has widespread use as a precursor for other organic compounds such as ethyl [[halide]]s, ethyl [[ester]]s, diethyl ether, acetic acid, and ethyl [[amine]]s.

===Solvent===
Ethanol is [[miscible]] with [[water (molecule)|water]] and is a good general purpose [[solvent]]. It is found in [[paint]]s, [[tincture]]s, markers, and personal care products such as mouthwashes, perfumes and deodorants. However, [[polysaccharides]] [[Ethanol precipitation|precipitate]] from aqueous solution in the presence of alcohol, and ethanol precipitation is used for this reason in the purification of [[DNA]] and [[RNA]].

===Low-temperature liquid===
Because of its low melting point (−114.14&nbsp;°C) and low toxicity, ethanol is sometimes used in laboratories (with [[dry ice]] or other coolants) as a [[cooling bath]] to keep vessels at temperatures below the freezing point of water. For the same reason, it is also used as the active fluid in [[alcohol thermometer]]s.

==Chemistry==
{{Further|Ethanol (data page)}}

===Chemical formula===
Ethanol is a 2-carbon alcohol. Its [[chemical formula|molecular formula]] is CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH. An alternative notation is CH<sub>3</sub>−CH<sub>2</sub>−OH, which indicates that the carbon of a [[methyl group]] (CH<sub>3</sub>−) is attached to the carbon of a [[methylene group]] (−CH<sub>2</sub>–), which is attached to the oxygen of a [[Hydroxyl|hydroxyl group (−OH)]]. It is a constitutional [[isomer]] of [[dimethyl ether]]. Ethanol is sometimes abbreviated as '''EtOH''', using the common organic chemistry notation of representing the ethyl group (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>−) with '''Et'''.

===Physical properties===
[[File:Spiritusflamme mit spektrum.png|thumb|upright|Ethanol burning with its spectrum depicted]]
Ethanol is a volatile, colorless liquid that has a slight odor. It burns with a smokeless blue flame that is not always visible in normal light. The physical properties of ethanol stem primarily from the presence of its [[hydroxyl]] group and the shortness of its carbon chain. Ethanol's hydroxyl group is able to participate in hydrogen bonding, rendering it more viscous and less volatile than less polar organic compounds of similar molecular weight, such as [[propane]].

Ethanol is slightly more refractive than water, having a [[refractive index]] of 1.36242 (at λ=589.3&nbsp;nm and {{convert|18.35|C|F|disp=or}}).<ref name="crc" /> The [[triple point]] for ethanol is {{nowrap|150 [[Kelvin|K]]}} at a pressure of {{nowrap|4.3 × 10<sup>−4</sup> [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webanswers.com/science/what-is-the-triple-point-of-alcohol-a821b3 |publisher=Webanswers.com |title=What is the triple point of alcohol? |date=31 December 2010 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514151711/http://www.webanswers.com/science/what-is-the-triple-point-of-alcohol-a821b3 |archive-date=14 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}{{SCICN|date=February 2014}}</ref>

Ethanol is a versatile solvent, [[miscible]] with water and with many organic solvents, including [[acetic acid]], [[acetone]], [[benzene]], [[carbon tetrachloride]], [[chloroform]], [[diethyl ether]], [[ethylene glycol]], [[glycerol]], [[nitromethane]], [[pyridine]], and [[toluene]].<ref name="crc" /><ref name="merck" /> It is also miscible with light aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as [[pentane]] and [[hexane]], and with aliphatic chlorides such as [[1,1,1-Trichloroethane|trichloroethane]] and [[tetrachloroethylene]].<ref name="merck">{{cite book | last = Windholz | first = Martha | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Merck index: an encyclopedia of chemicals and drugs|publisher=Merck|location=Rahway, N.J., U.S.A|year=1976|isbn=0-911910-26-3|edition=9th}}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Ethanol-xtal-1976-3D-balls.png|thumb|300px|Hydrogen bonding in solid ethanol at −186&nbsp;°C]]

Hydrogen bonding causes pure ethanol to be [[hygroscopic]] to the extent that it readily absorbs water from the air. The polar nature of the hydroxyl group causes ethanol to dissolve many ionic compounds, notably [[sodium hydroxide|sodium]] and [[potassium hydroxide]]s, [[magnesium chloride]], [[calcium chloride]], [[ammonium chloride]], [[ammonium bromide]], and [[sodium bromide]].<ref name="merck" /> [[Sodium chloride|Sodium]] and [[potassium chloride]]s are slightly soluble in ethanol.<ref name="merck" /> Because the ethanol molecule also has a nonpolar end, it will also dissolve nonpolar substances, including most [[essential oil]]s<ref name="merckoils">''Merck Index of Chemicals and Drugs'', 9th ed.; monographs 6575 through 6669</ref> and numerous flavoring, coloring, and medicinal agents.

The addition of even a few percent of ethanol to water sharply reduces the [[surface tension]] of water. This property partially explains the "[[tears of wine]]" phenomenon. When wine is swirled in a glass, ethanol evaporates quickly from the thin film of wine on the wall of the glass. As the wine's ethanol content decreases, its surface tension increases and the thin film "beads up" and runs down the glass in channels rather than as a smooth sheet.

===Flammability===

===Ethylene hydration===
Ethanol for use as an industrial feedstock or solvent (sometimes referred to as synthetic ethanol) is made from [[petrochemical]] feed stocks, primarily by the [[acid]]-[[catalysis|catalyzed]] hydration of ethylene:

: [[ethylene|{{chem|C|2|H|4}}]] + {{chem|H|2|O}} → {{chem|CH|3|C|H|2|OH}}

===Fermentation===
{{Main article|Ethanol fermentation}}
{{See also|Yeast in winemaking}}

Ethanol in [[alcoholic beverage]]s and fuel is produced by fermentation. Certain species of [[yeast]] (e.g., ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'') [[metabolism|metabolize]] [[polysaccharide|sugar]], producing ethanol and carbon dioxide. The chemical equations below summarize the conversion:

: [[glucose|{{chem|C|6|H|12|O|6}}]] → 2 {{chem|CH|3|C|H|2|O}}H + 2 CO<sub>2</sub>
: [[sucrose|{{chem|C|12|H|22|O|11}}]] + {{chem|H|2|O}} → 4 {{chem|CH|3|C|H|2|O}}H + 4 CO<sub>2</sub>

Fermentation is the process of culturing yeast under favorable thermal conditions to produce alcohol. This process is carried out at around {{convert|35|-|40|C|F}}. Toxicity of ethanol to yeast limits the ethanol concentration obtainable by brewing; higher concentrations, therefore, are obtained by [[Fortified wine|fortification]] or [[distillation]]. The most ethanol-tolerant yeast strains can survive up to approximately 18% ethanol by volume.

To produce ethanol from starchy materials such as [[cereal grain]]s, the [[starch]] must first be converted into sugars. In brewing [[beer]], this has traditionally been accomplished by allowing the grain to germinate, or [[malt]], which produces the [[enzyme]] [[amylase]]. When the malted grain is [[mashing|mashed]], the amylase converts the remaining starches into sugars.

====Cellulose====
{{Main article|Cellulosic ethanol}}

Sugars for [[ethanol fermentation]] can be obtained from [[cellulose]]. Deployment of this technology could turn a number of cellulose-containing agricultural by-products, such as [[corncob]]s, [[straw]], and [[sawdust]], into renewable energy resources. Other agricultural residues such as sugar cane bagasse and [[energy crop]]s such as [[switchgrass]] may also be a sources of fermentable sugars.<ref>{{cite web | last = Clines | first = Tom | name-list-format = vanc |title=Brew Better Ethanol|publisher=Popular Science Online|date=July 2006|url=http://www.popsci.com/popsci/energy/6756226d360ab010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103083747/http://www.popsci.com/popsci/energy/6756226d360ab010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html|archive-date=3 November 2007}}</ref>

===Testing===
[[File:EthanolMIRInfraredSpectra.PNG|thumb|300px|Infrared reflection spectra of liquid ethanol, showing the -OH band centered at ≈3300&nbsp;cm<sup>−1</sup> and C-H bands at ≈2950&nbsp;cm<sup>−1</sup>.]]

[[Image:Ethanol near IR spectrum.png|thumb|300px|[[Near infrared spectrum]] of liquid ethanol.]]

Breweries and [[biofuel]] plants employ two methods for measuring ethanol concentration. Infrared ethanol sensors measure the vibrational frequency of dissolved ethanol using the CH band at 2900&nbsp;cm<sup>−1</sup>. This method uses a relatively inexpensive solid state sensor that compares the CH band with a reference band to calculate the ethanol content. The calculation makes use of the [[Beer-Lambert law]]. Alternatively, by measuring the density of the starting material and the density of the product, using a [[hydrometer]], the change in specific gravity during fermentation indicates the alcohol content. This inexpensive and indirect method has a long history in the beer brewing industry.

==Purification==

===Distillation===
Ethylene hydration or brewing produces an ethanol–water mixture. For most industrial and fuel uses, the ethanol must be purified. [[Fractional distillation]] at atmospheric pressure can concentrate ethanol to 95.6% by weight (89.5 mole%). This mixture is an [[azeotrope]] with a boiling point of {{convert|78.1|C|F}}, and ''cannot'' be further purified by distillation. Addition of an entraining agent, such as [[benzene]], [[cyclohexane]], or [[heptane]], allows a new ternary azeotrope comprising the ethanol, water, and the entraining agent to be formed. This lower-boiling ternary azeotrope is removed preferentially, leading to water-free ethanol.<ref name="ullmann">{{cite book | first1 = Naim | last1 = Kosaric | first2 = Zdravko | last2 = Duvnjak | first3 = Adalbert | last3 = Farkas | first4 = Hermann | last4 = Sahm | first5 = Stephanie | last5 = Bringer-Meyer | first6 = Otto | last6 = Goebel | first7 = Dieter | last7 = Mayer | name-list-format = vanc | chapter = Ethanol | title = Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | year = 2011 | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a09_587.pub2 }}{{subscription required}}</ref>

At pressures less than atmospheric pressure, the composition of the ethanol-water azeotrope shifts to more ethanol-rich mixtures, and at pressures less than 70&nbsp;[[torr]] (9.333&nbsp;kPa), there is no azeotrope, and it is possible to distill absolute ethanol from an ethanol-water mixture. While vacuum distillation of ethanol is not presently economical, pressure-swing distillation is a topic of current research. In this technique, a reduced-pressure distillation first yields an ethanol-water mixture of more than 95.6% ethanol. Then, fractional distillation of this mixture at atmospheric pressure distills off the 95.6% azeotrope, leaving anhydrous ethanol at the bottom.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Molecular sieves and desiccants===
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2015}}

Apart from distillation, ethanol may be dried by addition of a [[desiccant]], such as [[molecular sieves]], [[cellulose]], and [[cornmeal]]. The desiccants can be dried and reused.<ref name="ullmann" /> [[Molecular sieve]]s can be used to selectively absorb the water from the 95.6% ethanol solution.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iEhAQAAMAAJ&q=Molecular+sieves+can+be+used+to+selectively+absorb+the+water+from+the+95.6%25+ethanol+solution&dq=Molecular+sieves+can+be+used+to+selectively+absorb+the+water+from+the+95.6%25+ethanol+solution&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiclr-d-4HXAhXHv1QKHbxaC8kQ6AEIKzAB|title=Advances in Cereal Science and Technology|last=Chemists|first=American Association of Cereal|date=1986|publisher=American Association of Cereal Chemists, Incorporated|isbn=9780913250457|language=en}}</ref> Synthetic [[zeolite]] in pellet form can be used, as well as a variety of plant-derived absorbents, including [[cornmeal]], [[straw]], and [[sawdust]]. The zeolite bed can be regenerated essentially an unlimited number of times by drying it with a blast of hot [[carbon dioxide]]. Cornmeal and other plant-derived absorbents cannot readily be regenerated, but where ethanol is made from grain, they are often available at low cost. Absolute ethanol produced this way has no residual benzene, and can be used to fortify port and sherry in traditional winery operations.

===Membranes and reverse osmosis===
Membranes can also be used to separate ethanol and water. Membrane-based separations are not subject to the limitations of the water-ethanol azeotrope because the separations are not based on vapor-liquid equilibria. Membranes are often used in the so-called hybrid membrane distillation process. This process uses a pre-concentration distillation column as first separating step. The further separation is then accomplished with a membrane operated either in vapor permeation or pervaporation mode. Vapor permeation uses a vapor membrane feed and pervaporation uses a liquid membrane feed.

===Other techniques===
A variety of other techniques have been discussed, including the following:<ref name="ullmann" />

* Salting using [[potassium carbonate]] to exploit its insolubility will cause a phase separation with ethanol and water. This offers a very small potassium carbonate impurity to the alcohol that can be removed by distillation. This method is very useful in purification of ethanol by distillation, as ethanol forms an [[azeotrope]] with water.

===Grades of ethanol===

====Denatured alcohol====
{{Main article|Denatured alcohol}}

Pure ethanol and alcoholic beverages are heavily [[Sin tax|taxed]] as psychoactive drugs, but ethanol has many uses that do not involve its consumption. To relieve the tax burden on these uses, most jurisdictions waive the tax when an agent has been added to the ethanol to render it unfit to drink. These include [[bitterant|bittering agents]] such as [[denatonium benzoate]] and toxins such as [[methanol]], [[naphtha]], and [[pyridine]]. Products of this kind are called ''denatured alcohol.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.procurement.umich.edu/Contracts/Denatured_Alchohol.pdf|title=U-M Program to Reduce the Consumption of Tax-free Alcohol; Denatured Alcohol a Safer, Less Expensive Alternative|publisher=University of Michigan|access-date=29 September 2007|format=PDF|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127095510/http://www.procurement.umich.edu/Contracts/Denatured_Alchohol.pdf|archive-date=27 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>Great Britain (2005).

====Absolute alcohol====
Absolute or anhydrous alcohol refers to ethanol with a low water content. There are various grades with maximum water contents ranging from 1% to a few parts per million (ppm) levels. If [[azeotropic distillation]] is used to remove water, it will contain trace amounts of the material separation agent (e.g. benzene).<ref>{{cite book|first=Raj K. |last=Bansal |last2=Bernthsen |first2=August | name-list-format = vanc |title=A Textbook of Organic Chemistry|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=1B6ijcTkD5EC|page=402}}|year=2003|publisher=New Age International Limited|isbn=978-81-224-1459-2|pages=402–}}</ref> Absolute alcohol is not intended for human consumption. Absolute ethanol is used as a solvent for laboratory and industrial applications, where water will react with other chemicals, and as fuel alcohol.

Pure ethanol is classed as 200 [[proof (alcohol)|proof]] in the U.S., equivalent to 175 degrees proof in the UK system.<ref name="Andrews2007">{{cite book|first=Sudhir |last=Andrews | name-list-format = vanc |title=Textbook Of Food & Bevrge Mgmt|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=HfHtaq1GWUcC&|page=268}}|date=1 August 2007|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07-065573-7|pages=268–}}</ref>

====Rectified spirits====
Rectified spirit, an azeotropic composition of 96% ethanol containing 4% water, is used instead of anhydrous ethanol for various purposes. Wine spirits are about 94% ethanol (188 [[proof (alcohol)|proof]]). The impurities are different from those in 95% (190 proof) laboratory ethanol.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kunkee RE, Amerine MA | title = Sugar and alcohol stabilization of yeast in sweet wine | journal = Applied Microbiology | volume = 16 | issue = 7 | pages = 1067–75 | date = July 1968 | pmid = 5664123 | pmc = 547590 }}</ref>

==Reactions==
{{Details|Alcohol}}

Ethanol is classified as a primary alcohol, meaning that the carbon its hydroxyl group attaches to has at least two hydrogen atoms attached to it as well. Many ethanol reactions occur at its [[hydroxyl]] group.

===Ester formation===
In the presence of acid catalysts, ethanol reacts with [[carboxylic acid]]s to produce ethyl [[ester]]s and water:
:[[carboxylic acid|RCOOH]] + HOCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> → [[ester|RCOOCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>]] + H<sub>2</sub>O
This reaction, which is conducted on large scale industrially, requires the removal of the water from the reaction mixture as it is formed. Esters react in the presence of an acid or base to give back the alcohol and a salt. This reaction is known as [[saponification]] because it is used in the preparation of soap. Ethanol can also form esters with inorganic acids. [[Diethyl sulfate]] and [[triethyl phosphate]] are prepared by treating ethanol with sulfur trioxide and [[phosphorus pentoxide]] respectively. [[Diethyl sulfate]] is a useful ethylating agent in [[organic synthesis]]. [[Ethyl nitrite]], prepared from the reaction of ethanol with [[sodium nitrite]] and sulfuric acid, was formerly used as a [[diuretic]].

===Dehydration===
Strong acid desiccants cause the partial dehydration of ethanol to form [[diethyl ether]] and other byproducts. If the dehydration temperature exceeds around {{convert|160|C|F}}, full dehydration will occur and [[ethylene]] will be the main product.
:2 CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH → [[diethyl ether|CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>]] + H<sub>2</sub>O (ca. 120 °C)
:&nbsp;&nbsp; CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH → [[ethylene|H2C=CH2]] + H<sub>2</sub>O (above 160 °C)

===Combustion===
Complete [[combustion]] of ethanol forms [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]]:
:C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH (l) + 3 O<sub>2</sub> (g) → 2 CO<sub>2</sub> (g) + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O (l); −ΔH<sub>c</sub> = 1371&nbsp;kJ/mol<ref>{{cite journal|title=Heats of Formation of Simple Organic Molecules | last = Rossini | first = Frederick D. | name-list-format = vanc  |journal=Ind.

Specific heat = 2.44 kJ/(kg·K)

===Acid-base chemistry===
Ethanol is a neutral molecule and the [[pH]] of a solution of ethanol in water is nearly 7.00. Ethanol can be quantitatively converted to its [[conjugate base]], the [[Alkoxide|ethoxide]] ion (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O<sup>−</sup>), by reaction with an [[alkali metal]] such as [[sodium]]:<ref name="m_and_b" />
:2 CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH + 2 Na → 2 CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>ONa + H<sub>2</sub>
or a very strong base such as [[sodium hydride]]:
:CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH + NaH → CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>ONa + H<sub>2</sub>
The acidity of water and ethanol are nearly the same, as indicated by their [[Acid dissociation constant|pKa]] of 15.7 and 16 respectively. Thus, sodium ethoxide and [[sodium hydroxide]] exist in an equilibrium that is closely balanced:
:CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH + NaOH {{eqm}} CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>ONa + H<sub>2</sub>O

===Halogenation===
Ethanol is not used industrially as a precursor to ethyl halides, but the reactions are illustrative. Ethanol reacts with [[hydrogen halide]]s to produce [[haloalkane|ethyl halides]] such as [[ethyl chloride]] and [[ethyl bromide]] via an [[SN2 reaction|S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction]]:
:CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH + [[hydrogen chloride|HCl]] → CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>Cl + H<sub>2</sub>O
These reactions require a catalyst such as [[zinc chloride]].<ref name="s_and_h">{{cite book | first1 = Andrew | last1 = Streitwieser | first2 = Clayton H. | last2 = Heathcock | name-list-format = vanc | author-link1 = Andrew Streitwieser | author-link2 = Clayton Heathcock | title = I ntroduction to Organic Chemistry|year=1976|publisher=MacMillan|isbn=0-02-418010-6}}</ref>
HBr requires [[refluxing]] with a [[sulfuric acid]] catalyst.<ref name="s_and_h" /> Ethyl halides can, in principle, also be produced by treating ethanol with more specialized [[Halogenation|halogenating agents]], such as [[thionyl chloride]] or [[phosphorus tribromide]].<ref name="m_and_b" /><ref name="s_and_h" />
:CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH + SOCl<sub>2</sub> → CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>Cl + SO<sub>2</sub> + HCl

Upon treatment with halogens in the presence of base, ethanol gives the corresponding [[haloform]] (CHX<sub>3</sub>, where X = Cl, Br, I).

===Oxidation===
Ethanol can be oxidized to [[acetaldehyde]] and further oxidized to [[acetic acid]], depending on the reagents and conditions.<ref name="s_and_h" /> This oxidation is of no importance industrially, but in the human body, these oxidation reactions are catalyzed by the [[enzyme]] [[liver alcohol dehydrogenase]]. The oxidation product of ethanol, acetic acid, is a nutrient for humans, being a precursor to [[acetyl CoA]], where the acetyl group can be spent as energy or used for biosynthesis.

'''Tetrodotoxin''' (TTX) is a potent [[neurotoxin]].  Its name derives from [[Tetraodontiformes]], an order that includes [[pufferfish]], [[porcupinefish]], [[ocean sunfish]], and [[triggerfish]]; several of these species carry the toxin.  Although tetrodotoxin was discovered in these fish and found in several other aquatic animals (e.g., in [[blue-ringed octopus]]es, [[rough-skinned newt]]s, and [[Naticidae|moon snails]]), it is actually produced by certain infecting or [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] [[bacteria]] like ''[[Pseudoalteromonas tetraodonis|Pseudoalteromonas]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas]],'' and ''[[Vibrio]]'' as well as other species found in animals.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Tetrodotoxin is a [[sodium channel blocker]]. It inhibits the firing of [[action potential]]s in neurons by binding to the [[voltage-gated sodium channels]] in [[neuron|nerve cell]] [[cell membrane|membranes]] and blocking the passage of sodium ions (responsible for the rising phase of an action potential) into the neuron.  This prevents the nervous system from carrying messages and thus muscles from flexing in response to nervous stimulation.<ref name="Bane_2014">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bane V, Lehane M, Dikshit M, O'Riordan A, Furey A | title =  Tetrodotoxin: Chemistry, Toxicity, Source, Distribution and Detection | journal = Toxins | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 693–755 | year = Feb 2014 | pmid = 24566728 | pmc = 3942760 | doi = 10.3390/toxins6020693 }}</ref>

Its mechanism of action, selective blocking of the sodium channel, was shown definitively in 1964 by [[Toshio Narahashi]] and [[John Wilson Moore|John W. Moore]] at [[Duke University]], using the [[sucrose gap]] [[voltage clamp]] technique.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Narahashi T, Moore JW, Scott WR | title = Tetrodotoxin blockage of sodium conductance increase in lobster giant axons | journal = The Journal of General Physiology | volume = 47 | issue = 5 | pages = 965–74 | date = May 1964 | pmid = 14155438 | doi=10.1085/jgp.47.5.965 | pmc=2195365}}</ref>

=== History ===
[[File:Zh pharmacopoeia 1.JPG|thumbnail|A Chinese Pharmacopoeia]]

The therapeutic uses of puffer fish ([[tetraodon]]) eggs were mentioned in the first Chinese pharmacopea (''Pen-T’ so Ching'', The Book of Herbs, allegedly 2838–2698 BC by [[Shénnóng Běn Cǎo Jīng]]; but [[Chinese herbology#History|a later date is more likely]]), where they were classified as having ‘medium’ toxicity, but could have a tonic effect when used at the correct dose. The principle use was “to arrest convulsive diseases”.<ref name=Kao66>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kao CY | title = Tetrodotoxin, saxitoxin and their significance in the study of excitation phenomena | journal = Pharmacological Reviews | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 997–1049 | date = Jun 1966 | pmid = 5328391 }}</ref>  In the ''Pen-T’ so Kang Mu'' (Index Herbacea or The Great Herbal by Li Shih-Chen, 1596) some types of the fish Ho-Tun (the current Chinese name for [[tetraodon]]) were also recognized as both toxic and (at the right dose)  could be used to prepare a tonic. Increased toxicity in Ho-Tun was noted in fish caught at sea (rather than river) after the month of March. It was recognized that the most poisonous parts were the liver and eggs, but that toxicity could be reduced by soaking the eggs,<ref name=Kao66 /> noting that tetrodotoxin is slightly water-soluble, and soluble at 1&nbsp;mg/mL in slightly acidic solutions.<ref>{{cite web|title=T8024 Sigma Tetrodotoxin|url=http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/t8024?lang=en|website=Catalogue|publisher=Sigma-Aldrich|accessdate=23 August 2015}}</ref>

The German physician [[Engelbert Kaempfer]], in his "A History of Japan" (translated and published in English in 1727), described how well known the toxic effects of the fish were, to the extent that it would be used for suicide and that the Emperor specifically decreed that soldiers were not permitted to eat it. There is also evidence from other sources that knowledge of such toxicity was widespread throughout southeast Asia and India.<ref name=Kao66 />

The first recorded cases of TTX poisoning affecting Westerners are from the logs of [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[James Cook]] from 7 September 1774.<ref name=uhm/> On that date Cook recorded his crew eating some local tropic fish (pufferfish), then feeding the remains to the pigs kept on board.  The crew experienced numbness and shortness of breath, while the pigs were all found dead the next morning.  In hindsight, it is clear that the crew survived a mild dose of tetrodotoxin, while the pigs ate the pufferfish body parts that contain most of the toxin, thus being fatally poisoned.

The toxin was first isolated and named in 1909 by Japanese scientist Dr. Yoshizumi Tahara.<ref name=Lago_2015/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Suehiro|first1=M|title=[Historical review on chemical and medical studies of globefish toxin before World War II].|journal=Yakushigaku Zasshi|date=1994|volume=29|issue=3|pages=428–34|pmid=11613509}}</ref><ref name=uhm/>  It was one of the agents studied by Japan's [[Unit 731]], which evaluated biological weapons on human subjects in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzlNgS70OHAC&pg=PA295|title=Weapons of Mass Destruction: Chemical and biological weapons|editor1=Eric Croddy |editor2=James J.

The diagnosis of pufferfish poisoning is based on the observed symptomatology and recent dietary history.<ref name="Harrisons98">{{cite book | last1 = Butterton | first1 = J.R. | last2 = Calderwell | first2 = S.B. | editor-first1 = Anthony S. | editor-last1 = Fauci | editor-first2 = Eugene | editor-last2 = Braunwald | editor-first3 = Kurt J.  | editor-last3 = Isselbacher | editor-first4 =  Jean D. | editor-last4 = Wilson | editor-first5 = Joseph B. | editor-last5 = Martin | editor-first6 =  Dennis L.  | editor-last6 = Kasper | editor-first7 =  Stephen L.  | editor-last7 = Hauser | editor-first8 = Dan L. | editor-last8 = Longo | name-list-format = vanc | chapter = Acute infectious diarrhoea disease and bacterial food poisoning | title =  Harrison's principles of internal medicine | date = 1998 | publisher = McGraw-Hill, Health Professions Division | location = New York | isbn = 0070202915 | pages = 796–601 | edition = 14th }}</ref>

Symptoms typically develop within 30 minutes of ingestion, but may be delayed by up to four hours; however, if the dose is fatal, symptoms are usually present within 17 minutes of ingestion.<ref name=uhm/> [[Paresthesia]] of the lips and tongue is followed by developing paresthesia in the extremities, [[hypersalivation]], [[Perspiration|sweating]], headache, weakness, lethargy, [[ataxia|incoordination]], [[tremor]], paralysis, [[cyanosis]], [[aphonia]], [[dysphagia]], and [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]]. The gastrointestinal symptoms are often severe and include [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], and [[abdominal pain]]; death is usually secondary to [[respiratory failure]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name="Harrisons98" /> There is increasing [[Shortness of breath|respiratory distress]], speech is affected, and the victim usually exhibits [[dyspnea]], [[cyanosis]], [[mydriasis]], and [[hypotension]]. Paralysis increases, and [[seizure|convulsions]], mental impairment, and [[cardiac arrhythmia]] may occur. The victim, although completely paralyzed, may be conscious and in some cases completely lucid until shortly before death, which generally occurs within 4 to 6 hours (range ~20 minutes to ~8 hours). However, some victims enter a [[coma]].<ref name=":0"/><ref name="Medscape_TTX">{{cite web | last1 = Benzer | first1 = Theodore | name-list-format = vanc | title = Tetrodotoxin Toxicity | url = http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/818763-overview|website=Medscape | accessdate = 23 August 2015 }}</ref>

If the patient survives 24 hours, recovery without any residual effects will usually occur over a few days.<ref name=Harrisons98/>

Therapy is supportive and based on symptoms, with aggressive early airway management.<ref name=uhm/> If ingested, treatment can consist of emptying the stomach, feeding the victim [[activated charcoal]] to bind the toxin, and taking standard life-support measures to keep the victim alive until the effect of the poison has worn off.<ref name=uhm/>  [[Alpha-adrenergic agonist|Alpha adrenergic agonists]] are recommended in addition to intravenous fluids to combat hypotension; [[anticholinesterase]] agents "have been proposed as a treatment option but have not been tested adequately".<ref name="Medscape_TTX" />

No [[antidote]] has been developed and approved for human use, but a primary research report (preliminary result) indicates that a [[monoclonal antibody]] specific to tetrodotoxin is in development by [[USAMRIID]] that was effective, in the one study, for reducing toxin lethality in tests on mice.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rivera VR, Poli MA, Bignami GS | title = Prophylaxis and treatment with a monoclonal antibody of tetrodotoxin poisoning in mice | journal = Toxicon | volume = 33 | issue = 9 | pages = 1231–37 | date = Sep 1995 | pmid = 8585093 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/0041-0101(95)00060-Y }}{{closed access}}</ref>

=== Geographic frequency of toxicity ===

Poisonings from tetrodotoxin have been almost exclusively associated with the consumption of pufferfish from waters of the Indo-Pacific ocean regions, but pufferfishes from other regions are much less commonly eaten. Several reported cases of poisonings, including fatalities, involved pufferfish from the Atlantic Ocean, [[Gulf of Mexico]], and [[Gulf of California]]. There have been no confirmed cases of tetrodotoxicity from the Atlantic pufferfish, ''[[Sphoeroides maculatus]]'', but in three studies, extracts from fish of this species were highly toxic in mice. Several recent intoxications from these fishes in Florida were due to [[saxitoxin]], which causes [[paralytic shellfish poisoning]] with very similar symptoms and signs. The trumpet shell ''[[Charonia|Charonia sauliae]]'' has been implicated in food poisonings, and evidence suggests it contains a tetrodotoxin derivative. There have been several reported poisonings from mislabelled pufferfish, and at least one report of a fatal episode in Oregon when an individual swallowed a rough-skinned newt ''[[Taricha granulosa]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bradley SG, Klika LJ | title = A fatal poisoning from the Oregon rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa) | journal = JAMA | volume = 246 | issue = 3 | pages = 247 | date = Jul 1981 | pmid = 7241765 | doi = 10.1001/jama.1981.03320030039026 }} {{closed access}}</ref>

In 2009, a major scare in the [[Auckland Region]] of [[New Zealand]] was sparked after several dogs died eating ''[[Pleurobranchaea maculata]]'' (grey side-gilled seaslug) on beaches.<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = McNabb P, Mackenzie L, Selwood A, Rhodes L, Taylor D, Cornelison C | date = 2009 | title = Review of tetrodotoxins in the sea slug ''Pleurobranchaea maculata'' and coincidence of dog deaths along Auckland Beaches. | publisher = Cawthron Institute for the Auckland Regional Council | work = Auckland Regional Council Technical Report 2009/108 | url = http://www.arc.govt.nz/albany/fms/main/Documents/Plans/Technical%20publications/Technical%20reports/2009%20100-150/TR2009108%20Review%20of%20toxins%20in%20the%20sea%20slug%20and%20coincidence%20of%20dog%20deaths%20along%20Auckland%20beaches.pdf }}</ref> Children and pet owners were asked to avoid beaches, and recreational fishing was also interrupted for a time.

;Statistical factors

Statistics from the Tokyo Bureau of Social Welfare and Public Health indicate 20–44 incidents of [[fugu]] poisoning per year between 1996 and 2006 in the entire country, leading to 34–64 hospitalizations and 0–6 deaths per year, for an average fatality rate of 6.8%.<ref name="tokyo">{{cite web |script-title =  ja:危険がいっぱい ふぐの素人料理 | trans-title =  Danger in fugu amateur cuisine | publisher = Tokyo Bureau of Social Welfare and Public Health | language = Japanese | url = http://www.mhlw.go.jp/topics/syokuchu/poison/animal_det_01.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100128100534/http://www.fukushihoken.metro.tokyo.jp/kenkou/anzen/anzen_info/shizendoku/hugu | archivedate = 28 January 2010 | deadurl = yes }}</ref> Of the 23 incidents recorded within Tokyo between 1993 and 2006, only one took place in a restaurant, while the others all involved fishermen eating their catch.<ref name="tokyo"/> From 2006 through 2009 in Japan there were 119 incidents involving 183 people but only 7 people died.<ref>{{cite web |script-title = ja: 自然毒のリスクプロファイル：魚類：フグ毒 | trans-title = Fish: fugu poison risk profile of natural poison | publisher = 厚生労働省 (Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare (Japan)) | language = Japanese | url = http://www.mhlw.go.jp/topics/syokuchu/poison/animal_det_01.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110927002233/http://www.mhlw.go.jp/topics/syokuchu/poison/animal_det_01.html | archivedate = 27 September 2011 | deadurl = no }}</ref>

Only a few cases have been reported in the United States, and outbreaks in countries outside the Indo-Pacific area are rare.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} In Haiti, tetrodotoxin is thought to have been used in [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] preparations, in so-called [[zombie]] poisons, where subsequent careful analysis has repeatedly called early studies into question on technical grounds, and have failed to identify the toxin in any preparation,<ref name = Kao86>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yasumoto T, Kao CY | title = Tetrodotoxin and the Haitian zombie | journal = Toxicon | volume = 24 | issue = 8 | pages = 747–49 | pmid = 3775790 | doi=10.1016/0041-0101(86)90098-x | year=1986}}</ref><ref name = Kao90>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kao CY, Yasumoto T | title = Tetrodotoxin in "zombie powder" | journal = Toxicon | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 129–32 | pmid = 2339427 | doi=10.1016/0041-0101(90)90330-a | year=1990}}</ref><ref name="Hines">{{cite journal | title = Zombies and Tetrodotoxin | first = Terence | last = Hines | name-list-format = vanc | url = http://www.csicop.org/si/show/zombies_and_tetrodotoxin | journal = Skeptical Inquirer | volume = 32 |issue=3 | date = May–June 2008 | pages =  60–62 }}</ref> such that discussion of the matter has all but disappeared from the primary literature since the early 1990s. Kao and Yasumoto  concluded in the first of their papers in 1986 that "the widely circulated claim in the lay press to the effect that tetrodotoxin is the causal agent in the initial zombification process is without factual foundation.”<ref name = Kao86/>{{rp|748}}

Genetic background is not a factor in susceptibility to tetrodotoxin poisoning. This toxicosis may be avoided by not consuming animal species known to contain tetrodotoxin, principally pufferfish; other tetrodotoxic species are not usually consumed by humans.

;Fugu as a food
Poisoning from tetrodotoxin is of particular public health concern in Japan, where pufferfish "[[fugu]]" is a traditional delicacy. It is prepared and sold in special restaurants where trained and licensed [[chef]]s carefully remove the [[viscera]] to reduce the danger of poisoning.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FvgNKPxb43IC&pg=PA390&dq=fugu+license&cd=2#v=onepage&q=fugu%20license|title=Molecules of death |first1=Rosemary H. |last1=Warin|first2=Glyn B. |last2=Steventon|first3=Steve C. |last3=Mitchell|publisher= Imperial College Press|year=2007|page=390|isbn= 1-86094-814-6}}</ref> There is potential for misidentification and mislabelling, particularly of prepared, frozen fish products.

=== Food analysis ===
The mouse bioassay developed for [[paralytic shellfish poisoning]] (PSP) can be used to monitor tetrodotoxin in pufferfish and is the current method of choice. An [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] method with post-column reaction with alkali and fluorescence has been developed to determine tetrodotoxin and its associated toxins. The alkali degradation products can be confirmed as their [[trimethylsilyl]] derivatives by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.

=== Detection in body fluids ===
Tetrodotoxin may be quantified in serum, whole blood or urine to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in the forensic investigation of a case of fatal overdosage. Most analytical techniques involve mass spectrometric detection following gas or liquid chromatographic separation.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Baselt | first1 = Randall C. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Disposition of toxic drugs and chemicals in man | date = 2008 | publisher = Biomedical Publications | location = Foster City, California | isbn = 978-0-9626523-7-0 | pages = 1521–22 | edition = 8th }}</ref>

==Popular culture==
Tetrodotoxin serves as a plot device for characters to fake death, as in the films ''[[Miami Vice]]'' (1985),<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0647033/?ref_=ttep_ep18 Miami Vice (1984–1990) Tale of the Goat]. IMDb</ref> ''[[Hello Again (1987 film)|Hello Again]]'' (1987), ''[[The A-Team (film)|The A-Team]]'' (2010) and ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014), and in episodes of ''[[Nikita (TV series)|Nikita]]'', ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'' Season 7, Episode 6, where the antidote is datura stramonium leaf, ''[[CSI: NY]]'' (Season 4, episode 9 "Boo") and ''[[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]''.  In ''[[Law Abiding Citizen]]'' (2009) its paralysis is presented as a method of assisting torture.  The toxin is used as a weapon in both the second season of ''[[Archer (TV series)|Archer]]'', in ''[[Covert Affairs]]'' and in the ''[[Inside No. 9]]'' episode "[[The Riddle of the Sphinx (Inside No. 9)|The Riddle of the Sphinx]]".<ref>{{cite web | first = Kitin | last = Miranda | name-list-format = vanc | title = Covert Affairs Recap: Starlings of the Slipstream | work = Movie News Guide | date = 26 November 2014 | url = http://www.movienewsguide.com/covert-affairs-recap-starlings-of-the-slipstream/37969 | access-date = 25 July 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | year = 2015 | title = Covert Affairs: Starlings of the Slipstream (season 5, episode 12, original air date 13 November 2014) | work = USA Networks | url = http://www.usanetwork.com/covertaffairs/episode-guide/season-5-episode-12-starlings-of-the-slipstream | access-date = 25 July 2015 }}</ref> In episode 16 of ''[[Dragon Ball]]'', the characters are inadvertently poisoned by a puffer fish soup. In season 2 episode 11 of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', Homer ingests an improperly cut Fugu and is given 22 hours to live. In [[Ghost in the Shell (2017 film)]], Ouelet is ordered to [[Euthanasia|euthanize]] Killian with a poison vial labeled with the chemical formula of tetrodotoxin.

In the sci-fi series ''[[Orphan Black]]'', a half organic, half mechanical "maggot bot" engineered by [[List of Orphan Black characters#Recurring|Evie Cho]] as a vector for gene therapy delivery to patients, makes use of tetrodotoxin as a defence mechanism to protect the device against tampering.

Based on the presumption that tetrodotoxin is not always fatal, but at near-lethal doses can leave a person extremely unwell with the person remaining conscious,<ref name=Harrisons98 /> tetrodotoxin has been alleged to result in [[zombie]]ism, and has been suggested as an ingredient in [[Haitian Vodou]] preparations.<ref name=Davis85 /> This idea first appeared in the 1938 non-fiction book ''Tell My Horse'' by [[Zora Neale Hurston]] in which there were multiple accounts of purported tetrodotoxin poisoning in Haiti by a voodoo sorcerer called the Bokor.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Hurston | first1 = Zora Neale | editor-first1 = Ishmael | editor-last1 = Reed | editor-first2 = Henry | editor-last2 = Louis | name-list-format = vanc | title = Tell my horse: Voodoo and life in Haiti and Jamaica | date = 2009 | pages=336| publisher = Harper Perennial | location = New York | isbn = 978-0061695131 | edition = 1st Harper Perennial Modern Classics}}</ref> These stories were later popularized by [[Harvard]]-trained [[ethnobotanist]] [[Wade Davis (anthropologist)|Wade Davis]]<ref name="Davis85">{{cite book | last1 = Davis | first1 = Wade | name-list-format = vanc | title = '[[The Serpent and the Rainbow (book)|The Serpent and the Rainbow]] | date = 1985 | publisher = Simon and Schuster | location = New York | isbn = 978-0671502478 | edition = 1st Touchstone }}</ref> in his 1985 book<ref>{{Oldid|page=The Serpent and the Rainbow (book)|oldid=733067345|label=The Serpent and the Rainbow (book)}}</ref> and [[Wes Craven]]'s 1988 film, both titled ''[[The Serpent and the Rainbow (film)|The Serpent And The Rainbow]]''.

'''Aprepitant''' (brand name: '''Emend''' (the brand name used in all English-speaking countries)) is an [[antiemetic]] chemical compound that belongs to a class of drugs called [[substance P]] antagonists (SPA). It mediates its effect by blocking the [[neurokinin 1]] (NK<sub>1</sub>) [[NK1 receptor|receptor]].

Aprepitant is manufactured by [[Merck & Co.]] under the brand name  '''Emend''' for prevention of acute and delayed [[chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting]] (CINV) and for prevention of [[postoperative nausea and vomiting]]. It was approved by the FDA in 2003.<ref name="urlDrug Approval Package: EMEND (Aprepitant) NDA #21-549">{{cite web | url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2003/21-549_Emend.cfm | title = Drug Approval Package: EMEND (Aprepitant) NDA #21-549 | format = | work = | accessdate = 2011-04-19}}</ref>

Aprepitant may also be useful in the treatment of [[cyclic vomiting syndrome]] and '''late-stage''' chemotherapy induced vomiting, but there are few studies to date.

On January 2008, the FDA approved [[fosaprepitant]], an intravenous form of aprepitant, which is to be sold under the tradename Emend Injection in the US and as Ivemend in some other countries.

== Structure and properties ==

Aprepitant is made up of a [[morpholine]] core with two substituents attached to adjacent ring [[carbon]]s. These substitute groups are trifluoromethylated [[phenyl ethanol]] and [[wikt:fluorophenyl|fluorophenyl]] group. Aprepitant also has a third substituent ([[triazolinone]]), which is joined to the morpholine ring [[nitrogen]]. It has three [[chiral centre]]s very close together, which combine to produce an [[amino acid|amino acetal]] arrangement. Its [[empirical formula]] is C<sub>23</sub>H<sub>21</sub>F<sub>7</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.

Aprepitant is an off-white [[crystalline]] [[solid]] that has a [[molecular weight]] of around 534.53.  It has a very limited [[solubility]] in water. It does have a reasonably high solubility in non-polar molecules such as oils. This would, therefore, suggest that aprepitant as a whole, despite having components that are polar, is a [[non-polar]] substance.

== Mechanism of action ==

Aprepitant is classified as an NK<sub>1</sub> [[antagonist]] because it blocks signals given off by [[NK1 receptor|NK<sub>1</sub> receptors]]. This, therefore, decreases the likelihood of vomiting in patients.

NK<sub>1</sub> is a [[G protein-coupled receptor]] located in the central and peripheral nervous system. This receptor has a dominant ligand known as Substance P (SP). SP is a [[neuropeptide]], composed of 11 amino acids, which sends impulses and messages from the brain. It is found in high concentrations in the [[vomiting center]] of the brain, and, when activated, it results in a vomiting reflex. In addition to this it also plays a key part in the transmission of pain impulses from the peripheral receptors to the central nervous system.

Aprepitant has been shown to inhibit both the acute and delayed emesis induced by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs by blocking substance P landing on receptors in the brain's neurons. [[Positron emission tomography]] (PET) studies, have demonstrated that aprepitant can cross the blood brain barrier and bind to NK<sub>1</sub> receptors in the human brain.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322304001854 | doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2004.02.007 | volume=55 | title=Human positron emission tomography studies of brain neurokinin 1 receptor occupancy by aprepitant | journal=Biological Psychiatry | pages=1007–1012 | pmid=15121485 | date=May 2004 | last1 = Bergström | first1 = M | last2 = Hargreaves | first2 = RJ | last3 = Burns | first3 = HD | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al}}</ref>  It has also been shown to increase the activity of the [[5-HT3 receptor]] antagonists [[ondansetron]] and the corticosteroid [[dexamethasone]], which are also used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gralla R, de Wit R, Herrstedt J, Carides A, Ianus J, Guoguang-Ma J, Evans J, Horgan K |title=Antiemetic efficacy of the neurokinin-1 antagonist, aprepitant, plus a 5HT3 antagonist and a corticosteroid in patients receiving anthracyclines or cyclophosphamide in addition to high-dose cisplatin: analysis of combined data from two Phase III randomized clinical trials |journal=Cancer |volume=104 |issue=4 |pages=864–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15973669 | doi = 10.1002/cncr.21222 }}</ref>

Aprepitant is taken orally in the form of a capsule. Before clinical testing, a new class of therapeutic agent has to be characterized in terms of preclinical metabolism and excretion studies.  Average [[bioavailability]] is found to be around 60-65%.  Aprepitant is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 with minor metabolism by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. Seven metabolites of aprepitant, which are only weakly active, have been identified in human plasma.  As a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, aprepitant can increase plasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal products that are metabolized through CYP3A4. Specific interaction has been demonstrated with [[oxycodone]], where aprepitant both increased the efficacy and worsened the side effects of oxycodone; however it is unclear whether this is due to CPY3A4 inhibition or through its NK-1 antagonist action.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Walsh | first1 = S.

No unchanged substance is excreted in urine.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/03/briefing/3928B1_01_Merck%20Backgrounder.pdf FDA Advisory Committee Background Package]</ref>

One of the main features of aprepitant, and a major advantage it has over other chemotherapy-induced side-effect treatments, is its ability to selectively antagonize NK<sub>1</sub> receptors, while having very low affinity to other common receptors such as serotonin, dopamine, and corticosteroid. It is estimated that aprepitant is at least 3,000 times more selective to NK<sub>1</sub> receptors compared to these other enzyme transporter, [[ion channel]]s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

== Synthesis ==

Shortly after Merck initiated research into the reducing the severity and likelihood of CINV, researchers discovered that aprepitant is effective in prevention. Researchers worked on coming up with a process to create aprepitant, and within a short period they came up with effective synthesis of the substance. This original synthesis was deemed to be workable and proved to be a crucial step in achieving commercialization; however, Merck decided that the process was not environmentally sustainable.  This was due to the original synthesis requiring six steps, many of which needed dangerous chemicals such as [[sodium cyanide]], dimethyltitanocene, and gaseous ammonia. In addition to this, for the process to be effective [[cryogenic]] temperatures were needed for some of the steps and other steps produced hazardous byproducts such as methane.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/jm980299k | volume=41 | title=Structural Optimization Affording 2-(R)-(1-(R)-3,5-Bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylethoxy)-3-(S)-(4-fluoro)phenyl-4- (3-oxo-1,2,4-triazol-5-yl)methylmorpholine, a Potent, Orally Active, Long-Acting Morpholine Acetal Human NK-1 Receptor Antagonist | year=1998 | journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | pages=4607–4614 | last1 = Hale | first1 = Jeffrey J.}}</ref>  The environmental concerns of the synthesis of aprepitant became so great that Merck research team decided to withdraw the drug from clinical trials and attempt to create a different synthesis of aprepitant.<ref name=NYAoS2011>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.05961.x | volume=1222 | title=Development of aprepitant, the first neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting | year=2011 | journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | pages=40–48 | last1 = Hargreaves | first1 = Richard}}</ref>

The gamble of taking the drug out of clinical trials proved to be successful when shortly afterwards the team of Merck researchers came up with an alternative and more environmentally friendly synthesis of aprepitant. The new process works by four compounds of similar size and complexity being fused together. This therefore is a much simpler process and requires only three steps, half the number of the original synthesis.

The new process begins by enantiopure trifluoromethylated phenyl ethanol being joined to a racemic morpholine precursor. This results in the wanted [[isomer]] crystallizing on the top of the solution and the unwanted isomer remaining in the solution. The unwanted isomer is then converted to the wanted one by the chemist controlling the reaction conditions and a process known as crystallization-induced asymmetric transformation occurring. By the end of this step a secondary [[amine]], the base of the drug, is formed.

The second step involves the fluorophenyl group being attached to the morpholine ring. Once this has been achieved the third and final step can initiated. This step involved a side chain of triazolinone being added to the ring.  Once this step has been successfully completed a stable molecule of aprepitant has been produced.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja027458g | volume=125 | title=Efficient Synthesis of NK1Receptor Antagonist Aprepitant Using a Crystallization-Induced Diastereoselective Transformation† | year=2003 | journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society | pages=2129–2135 | last1 = Brands | first1 = Karel M. J.}}</ref>

This more streamlined route yields around 76% more aprepitant than the original process and reduces the operating cost by a significant amount. In addition, the new process also reduces the amount of solvent and reagents required by about 80% and saving an estimated 340,000L per ton of aprepitant produced.<ref name="NYAoS2011"/>

The improvements in the synthesis process have also resulted in a decrease in the number long-term detrimental to the natural environment, due to elimination of hazardous chemicals from the procedure of this technique.

==Medical use==
Cisplatin is administered [[intravenously]] as short-term infusion in normal saline for treatment of solid malignancies. It is used to treat various types of cancers, including [[sarcoma]]s, some [[carcinoma]]s (e.g., [[lung cancer|small cell lung cancer]], [[squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck]] and [[ovarian cancer]]), [[lymphoma]]s, [[bladder cancer]], [[cervical cancer]],<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]] |title=Cisplatin |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/druginfo/cisplatin |access-date=2014-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008032500/http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/druginfo/cisplatin |archivedate=8 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and [[germ cell tumor]]s.

Cisplatin is particularly effective against testicular cancer; the cure rate was improved from 10% to 85%.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Einhorn LH | title = Treatment of testicular cancer: a new and improved model | journal = J. Clin. Oncol. | volume = 8 | issue = 11 | pages = 1777–81 | date = 1 November 1990 | pmid = 1700077 | url = http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/8/11/1777 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090422031132/http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/8/11/1777 | archivedate = 22 April 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

In addition, cisplatin is used in [[Auger therapy]].

Often, medical practitioners and researchers must be careful about how long cisplatin remains in DMSO due to not being stable in DMSO.

==Side effects==
Cisplatin has a number of side effects that can limit its use:
* [[Nephrotoxicity]] (kidney damage) is a major concern. The dose is reduced when the patient's creatinine clearance (a measure of [[renal function]]) is reduced. Adequate hydration and [[diuretic|diuresis]] is used to prevent renal damage. The nephrotoxicity of platinum-class drugs seems to be related to [[reactive oxygen species]] and in animal models can be ameliorated by [[free radical]] scavenging agents (e.g., [[amifostine]]). Nephrotoxicity is a dose-limiting side effect.<ref name="pmid6370067">{{cite journal | last1= Loehrer |first1=P. J. |last2=Einhorn |first2=L. H. | title = Drugs five years later. Cisplatin | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 704–13 | date = May 1984 | pmid = 6370067 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-100-5-704  }}</ref> 
* [[Neurotoxicity]] (nerve damage) can be anticipated by performing [[nerve conduction studies]] before and after treatment. Common neurological side effects of cisplatin include visual perception and hearing disorder, which can occur soon after treatment begins.<ref name="Milosavljevic_2010">{{cite journal | last1= Milosavljevic |first1=N. |last2=Duranton |first2=C. |last3=Djerbi |first3=N. |last4=Puech |first4=P.

Recent studies have shown that cisplatin noncompetitively inhibits an archetypal, membrane-bound mechanosensitive sodium-hydrogen ion transporter known as [[SLC9A1|NHE-1]].<ref name="Milosavljevic_2010"/> It is primarily found on cells of the peripheral nervous system, which are aggregated in large numbers near the ocular and aural stimuli-receiving centers. This noncompetitive interaction has been linked to hydroelectrolytic imbalances and cytoskeleton alterations, both of which have been confirmed in vitro and in vivo. However, NHE-1 inhibition has been found to be both dose-dependent (half-inhibition = 30&nbsp;µg/mL) and reversible.<ref name="Milosavljevic_2010"/>  
* [[Nausea]] and [[vomiting]]: cisplatin is one of the most emetogenic chemotherapy agents, but this symptom is managed with prophylactic antiemetics ([[ondansetron]], [[granisetron]], etc.) in combination with [[corticosteroids]]. [[Aprepitant]] combined with [[ondansetron]] and [[dexamethasone]] has been shown to be better for highly emetogenic chemotherapy than just [[ondansetron]] and [[dexamethasone]].
* [[Ototoxicity]] (hearing loss): there is at present no effective treatment to prevent this side effect, which may be severe.  Audiometric analysis may be necessary to assess the severity of ototoxicity. Other drugs (such as the aminoglycoside antibiotic class) may also cause ototoxicity, and the administration of this class of antibiotics in patients receiving cisplatin is generally avoided.  The ototoxicity of both the aminoglycosides and cisplatin may be related to their ability to bind to [[melanin]] in the [[stria vascularis]] of the inner ear or the generation of [[reactive oxygen species]].
* [[Electrolyte disturbance]]: Cisplatin can cause hypomagnesaemia, hypokalaemia and hypocalcaemia. The hypocalcaemia seems to occur in those with low serum magnesium secondary to cisplatin, so it is not primarily due to the cisplatin.
* [[Hemolytic anemia]] can be developed after several courses of cisplatin. It is suggested that an antibody reacting with a cisplatin-red-cell membrane is responsible for [[hemolysis]].<ref name="pmid6788166">{{cite journal | last1= Levi|first1= J.

== Mechanism of action ==
Cisplatin interferes with DNA replication, which kills the fastest proliferating cells, which in theory are carcinogenic.  Following administration, one of the two chloride atoms is slowly displaced by water to give the [[aquo complex]] ''cis''-[PtCl(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)]<sup>+</sup>, in a process termed [[aquation]].  Dissociation of the chloride is favored inside the cell because the intracellular chloride concentration is only 3–20% of the approximately 100&nbsp;mM chloride concentration in the extracellular fluid.<ref name="WangLippard2005">{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Dong|last2=Lippard|first2=Stephen J.|title=Cellular processing of platinum anticancer drugs|journal=Nature Reviews Drug Discovery|volume=4|issue=4|year=2005|pages=307–320|issn=1474-1776|doi=10.1038/nrd1691}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first1=Timothy C. |last1=Johnstone |first2=Kogularamanan |last2=Suntharalingam |first3=Stephen J. |last3=Lippard |title=The Next Generation of Platinum Drugs: Targeted Pt(II) Agents, Nanoparticle Delivery, and Pt(IV) Prodrugs |journal=[[Chem.

The water molecule in ''cis''-[PtCl(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)]<sup>+</sup> is itself easily displaced by the ''N''-[[heterocyclic base]]s on [[DNA]]. [[Guanine]] preferentially binds. Subsequent to formation of [PtCl(guanine-DNA)(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, crosslinking can occur via displacement of the other chloride, typically by another guanine.<ref name = trzaska/> Cisplatin crosslinks DNA in several different ways, interfering with cell division by [[mitosis]]. The damaged DNA elicits [[DNA repair]] mechanisms, which in turn activate [[apoptosis]] when repair proves impossible. In 2008, researchers were able to show that the  [[apoptosis]] induced by cisplatin on human colon cancer cells depends on the mitochondrial serine-protease [[HTRA2|Omi/Htra2]].<ref name="pmid18606591">{{cite journal | last1= Pruefer |first1=F. G. |last2=Lizarraga |first2=F. |last3=Maldonado|first3= V. |last4=Melendez-Zajgla |first4=J. | title = Participation of Omi HtrA2 serine–protease activity in the apoptosis induced by cisplatin on SW480 colon cancer cells | journal = J. Chemother. | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 348–54 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18606591 | doi = 10.1179/joc.2008.20.3.348 }}</ref> Since this was only demonstrated for colon carcinoma cells, it remains an open question if the Omi/Htra2 protein participates in the cisplatin-induced apoptosis in carcinomas from other tissues.

Most notable among the changes in DNA are the 1,2-intrastrand cross-links with [[purine]] bases. These include 1,2-intrastrand d([[guanine|Gp]]G) adducts which form nearly 90% of the adducts and the less common 1,2-intrastrand d([[adenosine|Ap]]G) adducts. 1,3-intrastrand d(GpXpG) adducts occur but are readily excised by the [[nucleotide]] excision repair ([[nucleotide excision repair|NER]]). Other adducts include inter-strand crosslinks and nonfunctional adducts that have been postulated to contribute to cisplatin's activity. Interaction with cellular proteins, particularly [[high mobility group|HMG]] domain proteins, has also been advanced as a mechanism of interfering with mitosis, although this is probably not its primary method of action.

Although cisplatin is frequently designated as an [[alkylating agent]], it has no [[alkyl]] group and it therefore cannot carry out alkylating reactions. It is correctly classified as alkylating-like.

=== Cisplatin resistance ===
Cisplatin combination chemotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment of many cancers. Initial platinum responsiveness is high but the majority of cancer patients will eventually relapse with cisplatin-resistant disease. Many mechanisms of cisplatin resistance have been proposed including changes in cellular uptake and efflux of the drug, increased detoxification of the drug, inhibition of [[apoptosis]] and increased [[DNA repair]].<ref name="Stordal_2007">{{cite journal | last1= Stordal |first1=B|last2=Davey|first2= M. | title = Understanding cisplatin resistance using cellular models | journal = IUBMB Life | volume = 59 | issue = 11 | pages = 696–9 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17885832 | doi = 10.1080/15216540701636287 }}</ref> [[Oxaliplatin]] is active in highly cisplatin-resistant cancer cells in the laboratory; however, there is little evidence for its activity in the clinical treatment of patients with cisplatin-resistant cancer.<ref name="Stordal_2007"/> The drug [[paclitaxel]] may be useful in the treatment of cisplatin-resistant cancer; the mechanism for this activity is unknown.<ref name="pmid17881133">{{cite journal | last1= Stordal|first1= B.|last2= Pavlakis |first2=N.|last3= Davey |first3=R. | title = A systematic review of platinum and taxane resistance from bench to clinic: an inverse relationship | journal = Cancer Treat.

===Transplatin===
Transplatin, the [[trans isomer|''trans'']] [[stereoisomer]] of cisplatin, has formula [[Trans-dichlorodiammineplatinum(II)|''trans''-[PtCl<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]]] and does not exhibit a comparably useful pharmacological effect. Two mechanisms have been suggested to explain the reduced anticancer effect of transplatin. Firstly, the ''trans'' arrangement of the chloro ligands is thought to confer transplatin with greater chemical reactivity, causing transplatin to become deactivated before it reaches the DNA where cisplatin exerts its pharmacological action. Secondly, the stereo-conformation of transplatin is such that it is unable to form the characteristic 1,2-intrastand d(GpG) adducts formed by cisplatin in abundance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Coluccia|first=Mauro|last2=Natile|first2=Giovanni|date=January 2007|title=Trans-platinum complexes in cancer therapy|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17266508|journal=Anti-Cancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry|volume=7|issue=1|pages=111–123|issn=1871-5206|pmid=17266508|doi=10.2174/187152007779314080}}</ref>

'''Histamine''' is an organic [[nitrogen]]ous compound involved in local [[immune system|immune responses]], as well as regulating physiological function in the gut and acting as a [[neurotransmitter]] for the brain, spinal cord, and uterus.<ref>{{cite book |author=Marieb, E. |title=Human anatomy & physiology |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |location=San Francisco |year=2001 |pages=414 |isbn=0-8053-4989-8 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nieto-Alamilla|first1=G|last2=Márquez-Gómez|first2=R|last3=García-Gálvez|first3=AM|last4=Morales-Figueroa|first4=GE|last5=Arias-Montaño|first5=JA|title=The Histamine H3 Receptor: Structure, Pharmacology, and Function.|journal=Molecular Pharmacology|date=November 2016|volume=90|issue=5|pages=649–673|doi=10.1124/mol.116.104752|pmid=27563055}}</ref> Histamine is involved in the [[inflammatory response]] and has a central role as a mediator of [[itching]].<ref name=andersen>{{cite journal |vauthors=Andersen HH, Elberling J, Arendt-Nielsen L |title=Human surrogate models of histaminergic and non-histaminergic itch |journal=Acta Dermato-Venereologica |year=2015 |pmid=26015312 |doi=10.2340/00015555-2146 |volume=95 |pages=771–7}}</ref> As part of an immune response to foreign [[pathogens]], histamine is produced by [[basophil]]s and by [[mast cell]]s found in nearby connective tissues.

== Properties ==
Histamine base, obtained as a mineral oil mull, melts at 83–84&nbsp;°C.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C51456&Mask=80|title=Histamine|website=webbook.nist.gov}}</ref> Hydrochloride<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/h7250?lang=en&region=US|title=Histamine dihydrochloride H7250|website=Sigma-Aldrich}}</ref> and phosphorus<ref>http://lib.njutcm.edu.cn/yaodian/ep/EP501E/16_monographs/17_monographs_d-k/histamine_phosphate/0144e.pdf</ref> salts form white [[hygroscopic]] [[crystal]]s and are easily dissolved in [[properties of water|water]] or [[ethanol]], but not in [[diethyl ether|ether]]. In [[aqueous solution]], histamine exists in two [[tautomer]]ic forms: ''N<sup>π</sup>-H''-histamine and ''N<sup>τ</sup>-H''-histamine. The imidazole ring has two nitrogens. The nitrogen farthest away from the side chain is the 'tele' nitrogen and is denoted by a lowercase tau sign. The nitrogen closest to the side chain is the 'pros' nitrogen and is denoted by the pi sign. The position of the nitrogen with the hydrogen on it determines how the tautomer is named. If the nitrogen with the hydrogen is in the tele position, then histamine is in the tele-tautomer form. The tele-tautomer is preferred in solution.

[[File:Histamine tautomers.svg|400px|thumbnail|center|Tautomers of histamine]]

Histamine has two [[base (chemistry)|basic]] centres, namely the [[aliphatic]] [[amino group]] and whichever [[nitrogen]] atom of the [[imidazole]] ring does not already have a [[hydrogen|proton]]. Under physiological conditions, the aliphatic amino group (having a [[dissociation constant|pK]]<sub>a</sub> around 9.4) will be [[protonated]], whereas the second nitrogen of the imidazole ring (pK<sub>a</sub> ≈ 5.8) will not be protonated.<ref name="Paiva 1970">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jm00298a025 | last1 = Paiva | first1 = T. B. | last2 = Tominaga | first2 = M. | last3 = Paiva | first3 = A. C.

Thus, histamine is normally protonated to a singly charged [[cation]]. Histamine is a [[monoamine neurotransmitter]].

== Synthesis and metabolism ==
Histamine is derived from the [[decarboxylation]] of the [[amino acid]] [[histidine]], a reaction [[catalyst|catalyzed]] by the [[enzyme]] [[L-histidine decarboxylase]]. It is a [[hydrophilic]] [[vasoactive]] [[amine]].

[[Image:Histidine decarboxylase.svg|thumb|center|433px|Conversion of [[histidine]] to histamine by [[histidine decarboxylase]]]]

Once formed, histamine is either stored or rapidly inactivated by its primary [[degradative enzyme]]s, [[histamine-N-methyltransferase]] or [[diamine oxidase]]. In the central nervous system, histamine released into the [[synapse]]s is primarily broken down by [[histamine-N-methyltransferase]], while in other tissues both enzymes may play a role. Several other enzymes, including [[MAO-B]] and [[ALDH2]], further process the immediate metabolites of histamine for excretion or recycling.

Bacteria also are capable of producing histamine using histidine decarboxylase enzymes unrelated to those found in animals.  A non-infectious form of foodborne disease, [[scombroid poisoning]], is due to histamine production by bacteria in spoiled food, particularly fish.  Fermented foods and beverages naturally contain small quantities of histamine due to a similar conversion performed by fermenting bacteria or yeasts.  [[Sake]] contains histamine in the 20–40&nbsp;mg/L range; [[wine]]s contain it in the 2–10&nbsp;mg/L range.<ref>http://astrobiology.berkeley.edu/PDFs_articles/WineAnalysisAnalChem.pdf</ref>

== Storage and release ==
[[Image:SMCpolyhydroxysmall.jpg|thumb|Mast cells.]]
Most histamine in the body is generated in granules in [[mast cells]] and in white blood cells (leukocytes) called [[basophils]]. Mast cells are especially numerous at sites of potential injury — the nose, mouth, and feet, internal body surfaces, and blood vessels.  Non-mast cell histamine is found in several tissues, including the [[brain]], where it functions as a neurotransmitter.  Another important site of histamine storage and release is the [[enterochromaffin-like cell|enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell]] of the [[stomach]].

The most important pathophysiologic mechanism of mast cell and basophil histamine release is [[immune system|immunologic]].  These cells, if sensitized by [[IgE]] [[antibody|antibodies]] attached to their [[cell membrane|membranes]], [[degranulation|degranulate]] when exposed to the appropriate [[antigen]].  Certain [[amine]]s and [[alkaloid]]s, including such drugs as [[morphine]], and [[curare]] alkaloids, can displace histamine in granules and cause its release. [[Antibiotic]]s like [[polymyxin]] are also found to stimulate histamine release.

Histamine release occurs when allergens bind to mast-cell-bound IgE antibodies. Reduction of IgE overproduction may lower the likelihood of allergens finding sufficient free IgE to trigger a mast-cell-release of histamine.

== Mechanism of action ==
In humans, histamine exerts its effects primarily by binding to [[G protein-coupled receptor|G protein-coupled]] [[histamine receptors]], designated H<sub>1</sub> through H<sub>4</sub>.<ref name="Histamine receptors" /> As of 2015, histamine is believed to activate ligand-gated chloride channels in the brain and intestinal epithelium.<ref name="Histamine receptors" /><ref name="FGID mast cell" />

== Roles in the body ==
Although histamine is small compared to other biological molecules (containing only 17 atoms), it plays an important role in the body. It is known to be involved in 23 different physiological functions. Histamine is known to be involved in many physiological functions because of its chemical properties that allow it to be versatile in binding. It is Coulombic (able to carry a charge), conformational, and flexible. This allows it to interact and bind more easily.<ref name="Noszal, B. pp 15-28">{{cite book |author1=Noszal, B. |author2=Kraszni, M. |author3=Racz, A. |chapter=Histamine: fundamentals of biological chemistry |editor1=Falus, A. |editor2=Grosman, N. |editor3=Darvas, Z. |title=Histamine: Biology and Medical Aspects |publisher=SpringMed |location=Budapest |year=2004 |isbn=380557715X |pages=15–28 }}</ref>

=== Vasodilation and a fall in blood pressure ===
When injected intravenously, histamine causes most blood vessels to dilate, and hence causes a fall in the blood pressure.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dale|first1=HH|last2=Laidlaw|first2=PP|title=The physiological action of beta-iminazolylethylamine.|journal=The Journal of Physiology|date=31 December 1910|volume=41|issue=5|pages=318–44|pmid=16993030|pmc=1512903|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1910.sp001406}}</ref> This is a key mechanism in [[anaphylaxis#Cardiovascular|anaphylaxis]], and is thought to be caused when histamine releases [[nitric oxide]], [[endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor]]s and other compounds from the endothelial cells.

=== Effects on nasal mucous membrane {{Anchor|Effects on Nasal Mucosa}} ===
Increased vascular permeability causes fluid to escape from capillaries into the tissues, which leads to the classic symptoms of an allergic reaction: a runny nose and watery eyes. Allergens can bind to [[IgE]]-loaded [[mast cell]]s in the [[nasal cavity]]'s [[mucous membrane]]s. This can lead to three clinical responses:<ref>

# hyper-[[secretion]] from glandular tissue
# nasal congestion due to vascular engorgement associated with [[vasodilation]] and increased [[capillary]] [[permeation|permeability]]

=== Sleep-wake regulation ===
Histamine is released as a neurotransmitter. The cell bodies of histamine neurons are found in the posterior [[hypothalamus]], in the [[tuberomammillary nucleus|tuberomammillary nuclei]]. From here, these neurons project throughout the brain, including to the [[brain|cortex]], through the [[medial forebrain bundle]]. Histamine neurons increase wakefulness and prevent [[sleep]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = RE | last2 = Stevens | first2 = DR | last3 = Haas | first3 = HL| title = The Physiology of Brain Histamine | journal = Progress in Neurobiology| volume = 63 | issue = 6 | pages = 637–672 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11164999 | doi=10.1016/s0301-0082(00)00039-3}}</ref> Classically, [[Histamine antagonist|antihistamines]] (H<sub>1</sub> histamine receptor antagonists) which cross the blood-brain barrier produce drowsiness. Newer antihistamines are designed to not cross into the brain and thus are less likely to cause sedation, although individual reactions, concomitant medications and dosage may increase the sedative effect. Similar to the effect of older antihistamines, destruction of histamine releasing neurons, or inhibition of histamine synthesis leads to an inability to maintain [[Alertness|vigilance]]. Finally, [[H3 receptor antagonist|H<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist]]s increase wakefulness.

Histaminergic neurons have a  wakefulness-related firing pattern. They fire rapidly during waking, fire more slowly during periods of relaxation/tiredness and completely stop firing during [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] and [[NREM]] (non-REM) sleep.

=== Gastric acid release ===
[[Enterochromaffin-like cell]]s, located within the gastric glands of the stomach, release histamine that stimulates nearby [[parietal cell]]s by binding to the apical H<sub>2</sub> receptor. Stimulation of the parietal cell induces the uptake of carbon dioxide and water from the blood, which is then converted to carbonic acid by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase.  Inside the cytoplasm of the parietal cell, the carbonic acid readily dissociates into hydrogen and bicarbonate ions. The bicarbonate ions diffuse back through the basilar membrane and into the bloodstream, while the hydrogen ions are pumped into the lumen of the stomach via a [[P-type ATPase|K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> ATPase pump]]. Histamine release is halted when the pH of the stomach starts to decrease. [[Receptor antagonist|Antagonist]] molecules, like [[ranitidine]], block the H<sub>2</sub> receptor and prevent histamine from binding, causing decreased hydrogen ion secretion.

=== Protective effects ===
While histamine has stimulatory effects upon neurons, it also has  suppressive ones that protect against the  susceptibility to [[convulsion]], drug sensitization, [[denervation supersensitivity]], ischemic lesions and stress.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Yanai | first1 = K | last2 = Tashiro | first2 = M | title = The physiological and pathophysiological roles of neuronal histamine: an insight from human positron emission tomography studies. | journal = Pharmacology & therapeutics | volume = 113 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–15 | year = 2007 | pmid = 16890992 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2006.06.008 }}</ref> It has also been suggested that histamine controls the mechanisms by which memories and learning are forgotten.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Alvarez | first1 = EO | title = The role of histamine on cognition. | journal = Behavioural Brain Research | volume = 199 | issue = 2 | pages = 183–9 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19126417 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbr.2008.12.010 }}</ref>

=== Schizophrenia ===
Metabolites of histamine are increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of people with [[schizophrenia]], while the efficiency of H<sub>1</sub> receptor binding sites is decreased. Many atypical [[antipsychotic]] medications have the effect of increasing histamine production, because histamine levels seem to be imbalanced in people with that disorder.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ito | first1 = C | title = The role of the central histaminergic system on schizophrenia | journal = Drug News & Perspectives | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 383–7 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15334189 | doi = 10.1358/dnp.2004.17.6.829029 | quote = Many atypical antipsychotics also increased histamine turnovers.}}</ref>

=== Multiple sclerosis ===
Histamine therapy for treatment of [[multiple sclerosis]] is currently being studied. The different H receptors have been known to have different effects on the treatment of this disease. The H<sub>1</sub> and H<sub>4</sub> receptors, in one study, have been shown to be counterproductive in the treatment of MS. The H<sub>1</sub> and H<sub>4</sub> receptors are thought to increase permeability in the blood-brain barrier, thus increasing infiltration of unwanted cells in the central nervous system. This can cause inflammation, and MS symptom worsening. The H<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>3</sub> receptors are thought to be helpful when treating MS patients. Histamine has been shown to help with T-cell differentiation. This is important because in MS, the body's immune system attacks its own myelin sheaths on nerve cells (which causes loss of signaling function and eventual nerve degeneration). By helping T cells to differentiate, the T cells will be less likely to attack the body's own cells, and instead attack invaders.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jadidi-Niaragh F, Mirshafiey A |title=Histamine and histamine receptors in pathogenesis and treatment of multiple sclerosis |journal=Neuropharmacology |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=180–9 |date=September 2010 |pmid=20493888 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2010.05.005 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0028-3908(10)00130-9}}</ref>

{{infobox calcium|engvar=en-GB}}
'''Calcium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Ca''' and [[atomic number]] 20. An [[alkaline earth metal]], calcium is a reactive pale yellow metal that forms a dark oxide-nitride layer when exposed to air. Its physical and chemical properties are most similar to its heavier homologues [[strontium]] and [[barium]]. It is the fifth most abundant element in Earth's crust and the third most abundant metal, after [[iron]] and [[aluminium]]. The most common calcium compound on Earth is [[calcium carbonate]], found in [[limestone]] and the fossilised remnants of early sea life; [[gypsum]], [[anhydrite]], [[fluorite]], and [[apatite]] are also sources of calcium.

The name derives from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''calx'' "lime", which was obtained from heating limestone. Its compounds were known to the ancients, though their chemistry was unknown until the seventeenth century. It was isolated by [[Humphry Davy]] in 1808 via [[electrolysis]] of its oxide, who named the element. While the pure metal does not have many applications due to its high reactivity, it is often used as an alloying component in small quantities in steelmaking, and calcium–lead alloys are sometimes used in automotive batteries. Calcium compounds on the other hand are very widely used in many industries: for example, they are used in foods and pharmaceuticals for calcium supplementation, in the paper industry as bleaches, in cement, in the manufacture of soaps, and as electrical insulators.

Calcium is the fifth most abundant element in the human body and the most abundant metal. Calcium ions play a vital role in the [[physiology]] and [[biochemistry]] of organisms and the [[cell (biology)|cell]] as [[electrolyte]]s. They play an important role in [[signal transduction]] pathways, where they act as a [[second messenger]], in [[neurotransmitter]] release from [[neurons]], in contraction of all [[muscle]] cell types, and in [[fertilization]]. Many [[enzymes]] require calcium ions as a cofactor. Calcium ions outside cells are also important for maintaining the [[potential difference]] across excitable [[cell membranes]], as well as proper bone formation.

==Characteristics==
===Classification===
Calcium is a very ductile silvery metal with a pale yellow tint whose properties are very similar to the heavier elements in its group, [[strontium]], [[barium]], and [[radium]]. A calcium atom has twenty electrons, arranged in the [[electron configuration]] [Ar]4s<sup>2</sup>. Like the other elements placed in group 2 of the periodic table, calcium has two [[valence electron]]s in the outermost s-orbital, which are very easily lost in chemical reactions to form a dipositive ion with the stable electron configuration of a [[noble gas]], in this case [[argon]]. Hence, calcium is almost always [[divalent]] in its compounds, which are usually [[ionic compound|ionic]]. Hypothetical univalent salts of calcium would be stable with respect to their elements, but not to [[disproportionation]] to the divalent salts and calcium metal, because the [[enthalpy of formation]] of MX<sub>2</sub> is much higher than those of the hypothetical MX. This occurs because of the much greater [[lattice energy]] afforded by the more highly charged Ca<sup>2+</sup> cation compared to the hypothetical Ca<sup>+</sup> cation.<ref name=Greenwood112>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 112–3</ref>

Calcium is considered to be an [[alkaline earth metal]], along with these heavier elements and the lighter [[beryllium]] and [[magnesium]]. Nevertheless, there are significant differences in chemical and physical properties between beryllium and magnesium (which behave more like [[aluminium]] and [[zinc]] respectively and have some of the weaker metallic character of the [[post-transition metal]]s) and the group members from calcium onwards, which traditionally led to "alkaline earth metal" only applying to the latter group.<ref>{{cite book |last=Parish |first=R. V. |date=1977 |title=The Metallic Elements |location=London |publisher=Longman |page=34 |isbn=0-582-44278-8}}</ref> This classification is mostly obsolete in English-language sources, but is still used in other countries such as Japan.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fukuma |first=Chihito |date=2013 |title=福間の無機化学の講義　三訂版 |publisher=株式会社 旺文社 |page=126 |isbn=9784010340172 |language=ja}}</ref> As a result, comparisons with strontium and barium are more germane to calcium chemistry than comparisons with magnesium.<ref name=Greenwood112/>

===Physical===
Calcium metal melts at 842&nbsp;°C and boils at 1494&nbsp;°C, higher than its adjacent group 2 metals do. It crystallises in the [[face-centered cubic]] arrangement like strontium; above 450&nbsp;°C, it changes to an [[anisotropy|anisotropic]] [[hexagonal close-packed]] arrangement like magnesium. The density of 1.55&nbsp;g·cm<sup>−3</sup> is the lowest in its group, with others decreasing towards it.<ref name=Greenwood112/> Calcium can be cut with a knife with effort, although it is still harder than [[lead]]. While calcium is a poorer conductor of electricity than [[copper]] or [[aluminium]] by volume, it is a better conductor than both of them by mass due to its very low density.<ref name=Ropp>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yZ786vEild0C&pg=PA16| pages = 12–5 | title = Encyclopedia of the Alkaline Earth Compounds | isbn = 978-0-444-59553-9 | author1 = Ropp | first1 = Richard C. | date = 31 December 2012}}</ref> Although it is infeasible for terrestrial applications as it reacts quickly with atmospheric oxygen, its use as a conductor in space has been considered.<ref name=Ullmann484>Hluchan and Pomerantz, p. 484</ref>

The chemistry of calcium is that of a typical heavy alkaline earth metal. For example, calcium spontaneously reacts with water more quickly than magnesium and less quickly than strontium to produce [[calcium hydroxide]] and hydrogen gas. It also reacts with the [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]] in the air to form a mixture of [[calcium oxide]] and [[calcium nitride]].<ref name="CRC">C. R. Hammond ''The elements'' (p. 4–35) in {{RubberBible86th}}</ref> When finely divided, it spontaneously burns in air to produce the nitride. In bulk, calcium is less reactive: it quickly forms a hydration coating in moist air, but below 30% [[relative humidity]] it may be stored indefinitely at room temperature.<ref name=Ullmann483>Hluchan and Pomerantz, p. 483</ref>

Besides the simple oxide CaO, the [[peroxide]] CaO<sub>2</sub> can be made by direct oxidation of calcium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow [[superoxide]] Ca(O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.<ref>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 119</ref> Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>, is a strong base, though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of strontium, barium or the alkali metals.<ref>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 121</ref> All four dihalides of calcium are known.<ref>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 117</ref> [[Calcium carbonate]] (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) and [[calcium sulfate]] (CaSO<sub>4</sub>) are particularly abundant minerals.<ref name=Greenwood122>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 122–5</ref> Like strontium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent [[lanthanide]]s [[europium]] and [[ytterbium]], calcium metal dissolves directly in liquid [[ammonia]] to give a dark blue solution.<ref name=Greenwood112/>

Due to the large size of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion, high coordination numbers are common, up to 24 in some [[intermetallic compound]]s such as CaZn<sub>13</sub>.<ref>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 115</ref> Calcium is readily complexed by oxygen [[chelate]]s such as [[ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid|EDTA]] and [[polyphosphate]]s, which are useful in [[analytic chemistry]] and removing calcium ions from [[hard water]]. In the absence of [[steric hindrance]], smaller group 2 cations tend to form stronger complexes, but when large [[polydentate]] [[macrocycle]]s are involved the trend is reversed.<ref name=Greenwood122/>

Although calcium is in the same group as magnesium and [[organomagnesium compound]]s are very commonly used throughout chemistry, organocalcium compounds are not similarly widespread because they are more difficult to make and more reactive, although they have recently been investigated as possible [[catalyst]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Harder|first1=S.|last2=Feil|first2=F.|last3=Knoll|first3=K.|year=2001|title=Novel Calcium Half-Sandwich Complexes for the Living and Stereoselective Polymerization of Styrene|journal=Angew.

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of calcium}}

Natural calcium is a mixture of five stable [[isotope]]s (<sup>40</sup>Ca, <sup>42</sup>Ca, <sup>43</sup>Ca, <sup>44</sup>Ca, and <sup>46</sup>Ca) and one isotope with a half-life so long that it can be considered stable for all practical purposes ([[calcium-48|<sup>48</sup>Ca]], with a half-life of about 4.3&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;years). Calcium is the first (lightest) element to have six naturally occurring isotopes.<ref name=CRC/>

By far the most common isotope of calcium in nature is <sup>40</sup>Ca, which makes up 96.941% of all natural calcium. It is produced in the [[silicon-burning process]] from fusion of [[alpha particle]]s and is the heaviest stable nuclide with equal proton and neutron numbers; its occurrence is also supplemented slowly by the decay of [[primordial nuclide|primordial]] [[potassium-40|<sup>40</sup>K]]. Adding another alpha particle would lead to unstable <sup>44</sup>Ti, which quickly decays via two successive [[electron capture]]s to stable <sup>44</sup>Ca; this makes up 2.806% of all natural calcium and is the second-most common isotope. The other four natural isotopes, <sup>42</sup>Ca, <sup>43</sup>Ca, <sup>46</sup>Ca, and <sup>48</sup>Ca, are significantly rarer, each comprising less than 1% of all natural calcium. The four lighter isotopes are mainly products of the [[oxygen-burning process|oxygen-burning]] and silicon-burning processes, leaving the two heavier ones to be produced via neutron-capturing processes. <sup>46</sup>Ca is mostly produced in a "hot" [[s-process]], as its formation requires a rather high neutron flux to allow short-lived <sup>45</sup>Ca to capture a neutron. <sup>48</sup>Ca is produced by [[electron capture]] in the [[r-process]] in [[type Ia supernova]]e, where high neutron excess and low enough entropy ensures its survival.<ref name="Cameron">{{cite journal | last1 = Cameron |first1 = A.

<sup>46</sup>Ca and <sup>48</sup>Ca are the first "classically stable" nuclides with a six-neutron or eight-neutron excess respectively. Although extremely neutron-rich for such a light element, <sup>48</sup>Ca is very stable because it is a [[magic number (physics)|doubly magic nucleus]], having 20 protons and 28 neutrons arranged in closed shells. Its [[beta decay]] to <sup>48</sup>[[scandium|Sc]] is very hindered because of the gross mismatch of [[nuclear spin]]: <sup>48</sup>Ca has zero nuclear spin, being [[even and odd atomic nuclei|even–even]], while <sup>48</sup>Sc has spin 6+, so the decay is [[forbidden mechanism|forbidden]] by the conservation of [[angular momentum]]. While two excited states of <sup>48</sup>Sc are available for decay as well, they are also forbidden due to their high spins. As a result, when <sup>48</sup>Ca does decay, it does so by [[double beta decay]] to <sup>48</sup>[[titanium|Ti]] instead, being the lightest nuclide known to undergo double beta decay.<ref name=NUBASE>{{cite journal|author=G.

Calcium is the only element to have two primordial doubly magic isotopes.

Apart from the practically stable <sup>48</sup>Ca, the longest lived [[radioisotope]] of calcium is <sup>41</sup>Ca. It decays by electron capture to stable <sup>41</sup>[[potassium|K]] with a half-life of about a hundred thousand years. Its existence in the early Solar System as an [[extinct radionuclide]] has been inferred from excesses of <sup>41</sup>K: traces of <sup>41</sup>Ca also still exist today, as it is a [[cosmogenic nuclide]], continuously reformed through [[neutron activation]] of natural <sup>40</sup>Ca.<ref name=Clayton/> Many other calcium radioisotopes are known, ranging from <sup>34</sup>Ca to <sup>57</sup>Ca: they are all much shorter-lived than <sup>41</sup>Ca, the most stable among them being <sup>45</sup>Ca (half-life 163&nbsp;days) and <sup>47</sup>Ca (half-life 4.54&nbsp;days). The isotopes lighter than <sup>42</sup>Ca usually undergo [[beta plus decay]] to isotopes of potassium, and those heavier than <sup>44</sup>Ca usually undergo [[beta minus decay]] to isotopes of [[scandium]], although near the [[nuclear drip line]]s [[proton emission]] and [[neutron emission]] begin to be significant decay modes as well.<ref name=NUBASE/>

The climate of present-day Italy being warmer than that of Egypt, the [[ancient Roman]]s instead used lime mortars made by heating [[limestone]] (CaCO<sub>3</sub>); the name "calcium" itself derives from the Latin word ''calx'' "lime".<ref name=Greenwood108/> [[Vitruvius]] noted that the lime that resulted was lighter than the original limestone, attributing this to the boiling of the water; in 1755, [[Joseph Black]] proved that this was due to the loss of [[carbon dioxide]], which as a gas had not been recognised by the ancient Romans.<ref name=Weeks/>

In 1787, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] suspected that lime might be an oxide of a fundamental [[chemical element]]. In his table of the elements, Lavoisier listed five "salifiable earths" (i.e., ores that could be made to react with acids to produce salts (''salis'' = salt, in Latin): ''chaux'' (calcium oxide), ''magnésie'' (magnesia, magnesium oxide), ''baryte'' (barium sulfate), ''alumine'' (alumina, aluminium oxide), and ''silice'' (silica, silicon dioxide). About these "elements", Lavoisier speculated: {{quote|We are probably only acquainted as yet with a part of the metallic substances existing in nature, as all those which have a stronger affinity to oxygen than carbon possesses, are incapable, hitherto, of being reduced to a metallic state, and consequently, being only presented to our observation under the form of oxyds, are confounded with earths. It is extremely probable that barytes, which we have just now arranged with earths, is in this situation; for in many experiments it exhibits properties nearly approaching to those of metallic bodies. It is even possible that all the substances we call earths may be only metallic oxyds, irreducible by any hitherto known process.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=adYKAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA218 page 218] of: Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans., ''Elements of Chemistry'', 4th ed.

Calcium, along with its congeners magnesium, strontium, and barium, was first isolated by [[Humphry Davy]] in 1808. Following the work of [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]] and [[Magnus Martin af Pontin]] on [[electrolysis]], Davy isolated calcium and magnesium by putting a mixture of the respective metal oxides with [[mercury(II) oxide]] on a [[platinum]] plate which was used as the anode, the cathode being a platinum wire partially submerged into mercury.

==Occurrence and production==
[[Image:Pamukkale Hierapolis Travertine pools.JPG|thumb|left|[[Travertine]] terraces in [[Pamukkale]], Turkey]]
At 3%, calcium is the fifth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and the third most abundant metal behind [[aluminium]] and [[iron]].<ref name=Greenwood108/> It is also the fourth most abundant element in the [[lunar highlands]].<ref name=Ullmann483/> [[Sedimentary rocks|Sedimentary]] [[calcium carbonate]] deposits pervade the Earth's surface as fossilised remains of past marine life; they occur in two forms, the [[rhombohedral]] [[calcite]] (more common) and the [[orthorhombic]] [[aragonite]] (forming in more temperate seas). Minerals of the first type include [[limestone]], [[dolomite]], [[marble]], [[chalk]], and [[iceland spar]]; aragonite beds make up the [[Bahamas]], the [[Florida Keys]], and the [[Red Sea]] basins. [[Coral]]s, [[sea shell]]s, and [[pearl]]s are mostly made up of calcium carbonate. Among the other important minerals of calcium are [[gypsum]] (CaSO<sub>4</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O), [[anhydrite]] (CaSO<sub>4</sub>), [[fluorite]] (CaF<sub>2</sub>), and [[apatite]] ([Ca<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>F]).<ref name=Greenwood108/>

The major producers of calcium are [[China]] (about 10000 to 12000 [[tonne]]s per year), [[Russia]] (about 6000 to 8000 tonnes per year), and the [[United States]] (about 2000 to 4000 tonnes per year). [[Canada]] and [[France]] are also among the minor producers. In 2005, about 24000 tonnes of calcium were produced; about half of the world's extracted calcium is used by the United States, with about 80% of the output used each year.<ref name=Ullmann484/> In Russia and China, Davy's method of electrolysis is still used, but is instead applied to molten [[calcium chloride]].<ref name=Ullmann484/> Since calcium is less reactive than strontium or barium, the oxide–nitride coating that results in air is stable and [[lathe]] machining and other standard metallurgical techniques are suitable for calcium.<ref name=Greenwood110>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 110</ref> In the United States and Canada, calcium is instead produced by reducing lime with aluminium metal at high temperatures.<ref name=Ullmann484/>

===Geochemical cycling===
Calcium provides a link between [[tectonics]], [[climate]], and the [[carbon cycle]]. In the simplest terms, uplift of mountains exposes calcium-bearing rocks to chemical weathering and releases Ca<sup>2+</sup> into surface water. These ions are transported to the ocean where they react with dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> to form [[limestone]], which in turn settles to the sea floor where it is incorporated into new rocks. Dissolved CO<sub>2</sub>, along with [[carbonate]] and [[bicarbonate]] ions, are termed "[[Total inorganic carbon|dissolved inorganic carbon]]" (DIC).<ref name=Berner/>

The actual reaction is more complicated and involves the bicarbonate ion (HCO{{su|b=3|p=−}}) that forms when CO<sub>2</sub> reacts with water at seawater [[pH]]:
:{{chem|Ca|2+}} + 2{{chem|HCO|3|-}} → {{chem|CaCO|3}} (limestone) + {{chem|CO|2}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}
At seawater pH, most of the CO<sub>2</sub> is immediately converted back into {{chem|HCO|3|-}}. The reaction results in a net transport of one molecule of CO<sub>2</sub> from the ocean/atmosphere into the [[lithosphere]].<ref>{{cite web|author= Zeebe|date=2006|url = http://www.eoearth.org/article/Marine_carbonate_chemistry|title = Marine carbonate chemistry|publisher = National Council for Science and the Environment|accessdate = 2010-03-13}}</ref> The result is that each Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion released by chemical weathering ultimately removes one CO<sub>2</sub> molecule from the surficial system (atmosphere, ocean, soils and living organisms), storing it in carbonate rocks where it is likely to stay for hundreds of millions of years. The weathering of calcium from rocks thus scrubs CO<sub>2</sub> from the ocean and atmosphere, exerting a strong long-term effect on climate.<ref name=Berner>{{Cite journal|last1=Berner|first1=Robert|title= The long-term carbon cycle, fossil fuels and atmospheric composition |journal=Nature|date=2003|volume=426|pages= 323–326|doi=10.1038/nature02131|pmid=14628061|issue=6964|bibcode = 2003Natur.426..323B }}</ref>

==Uses==
The largest use of calcium is in [[steelmaking]], due to its strong [[chemical affinity]] for oxygen and [[sulfur]]. Its oxides and sulfides, once formed, give liquid lime [[aluminate]] and sulfide inclusions in steel which float out; on treatment, these inclusions disperse throughout the steel and became small and spherical, improving castability, cleanliness and general mechanical properties. Calcium is also used in maintenance-free [[automotive battery|automotive batteries]], in which the use of 0.1% calcium–[[lead]] alloys instead of the usual [[antimony]]–lead alloys leads to lower water loss and lower self-discharging. Due to the risk of expansion and cracking, [[aluminium]] is sometimes also incorporated into these alloys. These lead–calcium alloys are also used in casting, replacing lead–antimony alloys.<ref name=Ullmann485>Hluchan and Pomerantz, pp. 485–7</ref> Calcium is also used to strengthen aluminium alloys used for bearings, for the control of graphitic [[carbon]] in [[cast iron]], and to remove [[bismuth]] impurities from lead.<ref name=Greenwood110/> Calcium metal is found in some drain cleaners, where it functions to generate heat and [[calcium hydroxide]] that [[Saponification|saponifies]] the fats and liquefies the proteins (for example, those in hair) that block drains.<ref name=Rumack/> Besides metallurgy, the reactivity of calcium is exploited to remove [[nitrogen]] from high-purity [[argon]] gas and as a [[getter]] for oxygen and nitrogen. It is also used as a reducing agent in the production of [[chromium]], [[zirconium]], [[thorium]], and [[uranium]]. It can also be used to store hydrogen gas, as it reacts with hydrogen to form solid [[calcium hydride]], from which the hydrogen can easily be re-extracted.<ref name=Greenwood110/>

Calcium isotope fractionation during mineral formation has led to several applications of calcium isotopes. In particular, the 1997 observation by Skulan and DePaolo<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Skulan|first1=J.|title=Biological control of calcium isotopic abundances in the global calcium cycle|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta |date=June 1997 | volume=61|pages=2505–10|last2=Depaolo|first2=D.

L.| last3= Owens |issue=12|doi=10.1016/S0016-7037(97)00047-1 | bibcode = 1997GeCoA..61.2505S }}</ref> that calcium minerals are isotopically lighter than the solutions from which the minerals precipitate is the basis of analogous applications in medicine and in paleooceanography. In animals with skeletons mineralized with calcium, the calcium isotopic composition of soft tissues reflects the relative rate of formation and dissolution of skeletal mineral. In humans, changes in the calcium isotopic composition of urine have been shown to be related to changes in bone mineral balance. When the rate of bone formation exceeds the rate of bone resorption, the <sup>44</sup>Ca/<sup>40</sup>Ca ratio in soft tissue rises and vice versa. Because of this relationship, calcium isotopic measurements of urine or blood may be useful in the early detection of metabolic bone diseases like [[osteoporosis]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Skulan|first1=J.|title=Natural calcium isotopic composition of urine as a marker of bone mineral balance|pmid=17463176|journal=Clinical Chemistry|date=2007|volume=53|pages=1155–1158|last2=Bullen|first2=T.|last3=Anbar|first3=A.

In 1997 Skulan and DePaolo presented the first evidence of change in seawater <sup>44</sup>Ca/<sup>40</sup>Ca over geologic time, along with a theoretical explanation of these changes. More recent papers have confirmed this observation, demonstrating that seawater Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is not constant, and that the ocean is never in a "steady state" with respect to calcium input and output. This has important climatological implications, as the marine calcium cycle is closely tied to the [[carbon cycle]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Fantle|first1=M.|last2=Depaolo|first2=D.|title=Ca isotopes in carbonate sediment and pore fluid from ODP Site 807A: The Ca<sup>2+</sup>(aq)–calcite equilibrium fractionation factor and calcite recrystallization rates in Pleistocene sediments|journal=Geochim Cosmochim Acta|date=2007|volume=71|pages=2524–2546|doi=10.1016/j.gca.2007.03.006|issue=10|bibcode=2007GeCoA..71.2524F}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Griffith|first1=Elizabeth M.|title=A Dynamic marine calcium cycle during the past 28 million years|pmid=19074345|journal=Science|date=2008|volume=322|pages=1671–1674|last2= Paytan |first2= Adina |last3= Caldeira |first3= Ken|last4= Bullen |first4= Thomas |last5= Thomas |first5= Ellen |issue=12|doi=10.1126/science.1163614 |bibcode = 2008Sci...322.1671G }}</ref>

Many calcium compounds are used in food, as pharmaceuticals, and in medicine, among others. For example, calcium and phosphorus are supplemented in foods through the addition of [[calcium lactate]], [[calcium diphosphate]], and [[tricalcium phosphate]]. The last is also used as a polishing agent in [[toothpaste]] and in [[antacid]]s. [[Calcium lactobionate]] is a white powder that is used as a suspending agent for pharmaceuticals. In baking, [[calcium monophosphate]] is used as a [[leavening agent]]. [[Calcium sulfite]] is used as a bleach in papermaking and as a disinfectant, [[calcium silicate]] is used as a reinforcing agent in rubber, and [[calcium acetate]] is a component of [[liming rosin]] and is used to make metallic soaps and synthetic resins.<ref name=Ullmann485/>

Calcium is an [[essential element]] needed in large quantities. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion acts as an [[electrolyte]] and is vital to the health of the muscular, circulatory, and digestive systems; is indispensable to the building of bone; and supports synthesis and function of blood cells. For example, it regulates the contraction of muscles, nerve conduction, and the clotting of blood. As a result, intra- and extracellular calcium levels are tightly regulated by the body. Calcium can play this role because the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion forms stable [[coordination complex]]es with many organic compounds, especially [[protein]]s; it also forms compounds with a wide range of solubilities, enabling the formation of [[skeleton]]s.<ref name=Ullmann489>Hluchan and Pomerantz, pp. 489–94</ref>

Calcium ions may be complexed by proteins through binding the [[carboxyl group]]s of [[glutamic acid]] or [[aspartic acid]] residues; through interacting with [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] [[serine]], [[tyrosine]], or [[threonine]] residues; or by being [[chelation|chelated]] by γ-carboxylated amino acid residues. [[Trypsin]], a digestive enzyme, uses the first method; [[osteocalcin]], a bone matrix protein, uses the third. Some other bone matrix proteins such as [[osteopontin]] and bone [[sialoprotein]] use both the first and the second. Direct activation of enzymes by binding calcium is common; some other enzymes are activated by noncovalent association with direct calcium-binding enzymes. Calcium also binds to the [[phospholipid]] layer of the [[cell membrane]], anchoring proteins associated with the cell surface.<ref name=Ullmann489/> As an example of the wide range of solubility of calcium compounds, [[monocalcium phosphate]] is very soluble in water, 85% of extracellular calcium is as [[dicalcium phosphate]] with a solubility of 2.0&nbsp;[[Molar concentration|mM]] and the [[hydroxyapatite]] of bones in an organic matrix is [[tricalcium phosphate]] at 100&nbsp;µM.<ref name=Ullmann489/>

About three-quarters of dietary calcium is from dairy products and grains, the rest being accounted for by vegetables, protein-rich foods, fruits, sugar, fats, and oil. Calcium supplementation is controversial, as the bioavailability of calcium is strongly dependent on the solubility of the salt involved: calcium citrate, malate, and lactate are highly bioavailable while the oxalate is much less so. The intestine absorbs about one-third of calcium eaten as the [[Radical ion|free ion]], and plasma calcium level is then regulated by the kidneys. [[Parathyroid hormone]] and [[vitamin D]] promote the formation of bone by allowing and enhancing the deposition of calcium ions there, allowing rapid bone turnover without affecting bone mass or mineral content. When plasma calcium levels fall, cell surface receptors are activated and the secretion of parathyroid hormone occurs; it then proceeds to stimulate the entry of calcium into the plasma pool by taking it from targeted kidney, gut, and bone cells, with the bone-forming action of parathyroid hormone being antagonised by [[calcitonin]], whose secretion increases with increasing plasma calcium levels.<ref name=Ullmann489/>

Excess intake of calcium may cause [[hypercalcaemia]], but because of the inefficient absorption of calcium by the intestines a more likely cause is excessive vitamin D intake or excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone. It can also occur due to the bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasise to bone. This results in deposition of calcium salts into the heart, the blood vessels, and the kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia may lead to soft tissue [[calcification]], which can lead to serious consequences: for example, calcification of the [[vascular wall]] can lead to a loss of elasticity and the disruption of laminar blood flow, and thence to [[Vulnerable plaque|plaque rupture]] and [[thrombosis]]. Likewise, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intake results in [[hypocalcaemia]], often caused by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective receptors to it in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, potentially causing [[tetany]] and defects in cardiac conduction.<ref name=Ullmann489/>

As calcium is heavily involved in bone manufacture, many bone diseases can be traced to problems with the organic matrix or the hydroxyapatite in molecular structure or organisation. For example, [[osteoporosis]] is a reduction in mineral content of bone per unit volume, and can be treated by supplementation of calcium, vitamin D, and biphosphates. Calcium supplements may benefit the serum lipids in women who have passed [[menopause]] as well as older men; in post-menopausal women calcium supplementation also appears to be inversely correlated with cardiovascular disease. Inadequate amounts of calcium, vitamin D, or phosphates can lead to the softening of bones, known as [[osteomalacia]].<ref name=Ullmann489/>

==Safety==
Because calcium reacts exothermically with water and acids, contact of calcium metal with bodily moisture results in severe corrosive irritation.<ref name=Ullmann487/> When swallowed, calcium metal has the same effect on the mouth, oesophagus, and stomach, and can be fatal.<ref name=Rumack>Rumack BH. POISINDEX. Information System Micromedex, Inc., Englewood, CO, 2010; CCIS Volume 143. Hall AH and Rumack BH (Eds)</ref> However, long-term exposure is not known to have distinct adverse effects.<ref name=Ullmann487>Hluchan and Pomerantz, pp. 487–9</ref>

Because of concerns of long-term adverse side effects such as calcification of arteries and kidney stones, the U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) both set [[Tolerable upper intake level|Tolerable Upper Intake Levels]] (ULs) for the combination of dietary and supplemental calcium. From the IOM, people ages 9–18 years are not supposed to exceed 3,000&nbsp;mg/day; for ages 19–50 not to exceed 2,500&nbsp;mg/day; for ages 51 and older, not to exceed 2,000&nbsp;mg/day.<ref>{{cite book | title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium and Vitamin D, Chapter 6 Tolerable Upper Intake Levels pages 403–456 | publisher = National Academies Press | location = Washington, D.C | year = 2011 | isbn = 0-309-16394-3 | url = https://www.nap.edu/read/13050/chapter/8}}</ref> The EFSA set UL at 2,500&nbsp;mg/day for adults but decided the information for children and adolescents was not sufficient to determine ULs.<ref>{{citation| title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf}}</ref>

===Antiprotozoal===
It is used in [[prophylaxis]] against [[malaria]].  It should not be used alone for initial treatment of malaria, even when the parasite is doxycycline-sensitive, because the antimalarial effect of doxycycline is delayed. This delay is related to its mechanism of action, which is to specifically impair the progeny of the [[apicoplast]] genes, resulting in their abnormal cell division.<ref name="pmid16940111">{{cite journal |vauthors=Dahl EL, Shock JL, Shenai BR, Gut J, DeRisi JL, Rosenthal PJ | title=Tetracyclines specifically target the apicoplast of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum | journal=Antimicrob.

==Adverse effects==
Cautions and side effects are similar to those of other members of the [[Tetracycline antibiotics|tetracycline]] antibiotic group.

An [[erythematous]] rash in sun-exposed parts of the body has been reported to occur in 7.3–21.2% of persons taking doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis. One study examined the tolerability of various malaria prophylactic regimens and found doxycycline did not cause a significantly higher percentage of all skin events (photosensitivity not specified) when compared with other antimalarials. The rash resolves upon discontinuation of the drug.<ref>{{cite web |author=Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |title=Doxycycline for Malaria Chemoprophylaxis and Treatment: Report from the CDC Expert Meeting on Malaria Chemoprophylaxis |url=http://www.ajtmh.org/content/84/4/517.full |year=2011 |publisher=[[The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene]] |accessdate=17 May 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705202814/http://www.ajtmh.org/content/84/4/517.full |archivedate=5 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}{{Verify source|date=March 2011}}</ref>

===Interactions===
The combination of doxycycline with dairy, antacids, calcium supplements, iron products, and laxatives containing magnesium is not inherently dangerous, but any of these foods and supplements may decrease doxycycline's effectiveness.<ref>{{cite web|author=PubMed Health|title=Doxycycline (By mouth)|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0010039/?report=details|date=July 1, 2016|publisher=[[U.S. National Library of Medicine]]|accessdate=July 16, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111164820/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0010039/?report=details|archivedate=11 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

<blockquote>Breakfast was observed to reduce doxycycline absorption significantly. Absorption of tetracycline occurs in the stomach and the upper small intestine. Absorption of tetracyclines has been reported to be impaired by milk products, aluminum hydroxide gels, sodium bicarbonate, calcium and magnesium salts, laxatives containing magnesium and iron preparations. The mechanisms responsible for decreased absorption appear to be chelation and an increase in gastric pH. ... In view of these results, it is advisable to instruct the patients to take doxycycline on an empty stomach.<ref>[http://www.jpgmonline.com/article.asp?issn=0022-3859;year=1987;volume=33;issue=3;spage=117;epage=9;aulast=Kshirsagar Kshirsagar N A, Ankalesaria P S.

Previously, doxycycline was believed to impair the effectiveness of many types of [[hormonal contraception]] due to [[Cytochrome P450|CYP450]] induction. Recent research has shown no significant loss of effectiveness in oral contraceptives while using most tetracycline antibiotics (including doxycycline), although many physicians still recommend the use of barrier contraception for people taking the drug to prevent unwanted pregnancy.<ref name="pmid12063491">{{cite journal |vauthors=Archer JS, Archer DF |title=Oral contraceptive efficacy and antibiotic interaction: a myth debunked |journal=J.

===Pregnancy and lactation===
Doxycycline is categorized by the FDA as a class D drug in pregnancy. As with all tetracycline antibiotics, it is contraindicated in pregnancy through infancy and childhood up to eight years of age, due to the potential for disrupting bone and tooth development.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mylonas|first=I|title=Antibiotic chemotherapy during pregnancy and lactation period: aspects for consideration.|journal=Archives of gynecology and obstetrics|date=January 2011|volume=283|issue=1|pages=7–18|pmid=20814687|doi=10.1007/s00404-010-1646-3}}</ref> Therefore, doxycycline should not be administered to children under the age of eight except in the treatment of anthrax or where other medications are contraindicated or ineffective.<ref name="FDA capsules label"/>

Doxycycline crosses into breastmilk. The adverse effects on teeth and long bones of children directly administered tetracycline antibiotics is documented, but these effects have not been recorded in infants exposed through breastmilk. Although the dose an infant would receive through breastfeeding would likely be minimal, a theoretical risk exists.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chung|first=AM|author2=Reed, MD |author3=Blumer, JL |title=Antibiotics and breast-feeding: a critical review of the literature.|journal=Paediatric drugs|year=2002|volume=4|issue=12|pages=817–37|pmid=12431134|doi=10.2165/00128072-200204120-00006}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
{{see also|Tetracycline antibiotics#Mechanism of action}}
Doxycycline, like other tetracycline antibiotics, is [[Bacteriostatic agent|bacteriostatic]]. It works by preventing bacteria from reproducing through the inhibition of protein synthesis.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Flower, R. |author2=Rang, H. P. |author3=Dale, M. M. |author4=Ritter, J.

Doxycycline–metal ion complexes are unstable at acid pH, therefore more doxycycline enters the duodenum for absorption than the earlier tetracycline compounds.  In addition, food has less effect on absorption than on absorption of earlier drugs with doxycycline serum concentrations being reduced by about 20% by test meals compared with 50% for tetracycline.<ref name="pmid16816396">{{cite journal |author1=Agwuh, KN |author2=MacGowan, A |title=Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the tetracyclines including glycylcyclines |journal=J.

==History==
After [[penicillin]] revolutionized the treatment of bacterial infections in WWII, many chemical companies moved into the field of discovering antibiotics by [[bioprospecting]]. [[American Cyanamid]] was one of these, and in the late 1940s chemists there discovered [[chlortetracycline]], the first member of the [[tetracycline]] class of antibiotics.<ref name=Tetrahist>{{cite journal |vauthors=Nelson ML, Levy SB | date = Dec 2011 | title = The history of the tetracyclines | url = | journal = Ann N Y Acad Sci | volume = 1241 | issue = | pages = 17–32 | pmid = 22191524 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.06354.x}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, scientists at Pfizer discovered [[terramycin]] and it was brought to market.  Both compounds, like penicillin, were natural products and it was commonly believed that nature had perfected them, and further chemical changes could only degrade their effectiveness.  Scientists at Pfizer led by [[Lloyd Conover]] modified these compounds, which led to the invention of tetracycline itself, the first semi-synthetic antibiotic. Charlie Stephens' group at Pfizer worked on further analogs and created one with greatly improved stability and pharmacological efficacy: doxycycline.  It was clinically developed in the early 1960s and approved by the FDA in 1967.<ref name=Tetrahist/>

The mechanism of action for the antibacterial effect of tetracyclines relies on disrupting protein translation in bacteria, thereby damaging the ability of microbes to grow and repair; however protein translation is also disrupted in eukaryotic [[mitochondria]] impairing metabolism and leading to effects that can [[confound]] experimental results.<ref name="pmid25772356">{{cite journal |vauthors=Moullan N, Mouchiroud L, Wang X, Ryu D, Williams EG, Mottis A, Jovaisaite V, Frochaux MV, Quiros PM, Deplancke B, Houtkooper RH, Auwerx J|title=Tetracyclines Disturb Mitochondrial Function across Eukaryotic Models: A Call for Caution in Biomedical Research. |journal=Celll Reports |volume=10 |issue=10 |pages=1681–91 |year=2015|pmid=25772356|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2015.02.034}}</ref><ref name="pmid26475870">{{cite journal |vauthors=Chatzispyrou IA, Held NM, Mouchiroud L, Auwerx J, Houtkooper RH |title=Tetracycline antibiotics impair mitochondrial function and its experimental use confounds research. |journal=Cancer Research |volume= 75|issue=21 |pages=4446–9|year=2015|pmid=26475870|doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-1626}}</ref> Doxycycline may have anticancer activity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ali|first1=Isra|last2=Alfarouk|first2=Khalid Omer|last3=Reshkin|first3=Stephan Joel|last4=Ibrahim|first4=Muntaser Eltayeb|title=Doxycycline as Potential Anti-cancer Agent|journal=Anti-Cancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry|date=2017|volume=17|issue=12|pages=1617–1623|doi=10.2174/1871520617666170213111951|pmid=28270076|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28270076}}</ref>

The '''proteome''' is the entire set of [[protein]]s expressed by a [[genome]], cell, tissue, or organism at a certain time. More specifically, it is the set of expressed proteins in a given type of cell or organism, at a given time, under defined conditions. [[Proteomics]] is the study of the proteome.

==Systems==
The term has been applied to several different types of biological systems. A '''cellular proteome''' is the collection of proteins found in a particular [[cell (biology)|cell]] type under a particular set of environmental conditions such as exposure to [[hormone|hormone stimulation]]. It can also be useful to consider an organism's '''complete proteome''', which can be conceptualized as the complete set of proteins from all of the various cellular proteomes. This is very roughly the protein equivalent of the [[genome]]. The term "proteome" has also been used to refer to the collection of proteins in certain sub-cellular biological systems. For example, all of the proteins in a virus can be called a viral proteome.

==History==
[[Marc Wilkins (geneticist)|Marc Wilkins]] coined the term ''proteome'' <ref>{{cite journal|last=Wilkins|first=Marc|date=Dec 2009|title=Proteomics data mining|journal=[[Expert review of proteomics]]|volume=6|issue=6|pages=599–603|publisher= |location = [[England]]| pmid = 19929606|doi = 10.1586/epr.09.81

It appeared in print in 1995,<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Wasinger VC, Cordwell SJ, Cerpa-Poljak A, Yan JX, Gooley AA, Wilkins MR, Duncan MW, Harris R, Williams KL, Humphery-Smith I | journal=Electrophoresis| year=1995|title= Progress with gene-product mapping of the Mollicutes: Mycoplasma genitalium| pmid = 7498152| volume=16| pages=1090–94| issue=1| doi=10.1002/elps.11501601185}}</ref> with the publication of part of Wilkins's PhD thesis. Wilkins used the term to describe the entire complement of [[protein]]s expressed by a genome, cell, tissue or organism.

==Size and contents==
The proteome can be larger than the [[genome]], especially in [[eukaryota|eukaryotes]], as more than one [[protein]] can be produced from one [[gene]] due to [[alternative splicing]] (e.g. human proteome consists 92,179 proteins out of which 71,173 are splicing variants).<ref>{{cite journal|title=UniProt: a hub for protein information|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=43|issue=D1|year=2014|pages=D204–D212|issn=0305-1048|doi=10.1093/nar/gku989|pmid=25348405|pmc=4384041}}</ref> On the other hand, not all genes are translated to proteins, and many known genes encode only RNA which is the final functional product. Moreover, complete proteome size vary depending the kingdom of life. For instance, eukaryotes, [[bacteria]], [[Archaea]] and [[viruses]] have on average 15145, 3200, 2358 and 42 proteins respectively encoded in their genomes.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kozlowski|first1=LP|title=Proteome-pI: proteome isoelectric point database.|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=26 October 2016|doi=10.1093/nar/gkw978|pmid=27789699|page=gkw978}}</ref>

===Dark proteome===
Perdigão and co-workers surveyed the “dark” proteome – that is, regions of proteins never observed by experimental structure determination and inaccessible to homology modeling. For 546,000 Swiss-Prot proteins, they found that 44–54% of the proteome in [[eukaryote]]s and viruses was "dark", compared with only ∼14% in [[archaea]] and [[bacteria]]. Surprisingly, most of the dark proteome could not be accounted for by conventional explanations, such as intrinsic disorder or [[Transmembrane protein|transmembrane regions]]. Nearly half of the dark proteome comprised dark proteins, in which the entire sequence lacked similarity to any known structure. Dark proteins fulfill a wide variety of functions, but a subset showed distinct and largely unexpected features, such as association with [[secretion]], specific tissues, the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], [[Disulfide|disulfide bonding]], and [[Protease|proteolytic cleavage]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Perdigão | first1 = Nelson | display-authors=etal | year = 2015 | title = Unexpected features of the dark proteome | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/112/52/15898.abstract.html | journal = PNAS | volume = 112 | issue = 52| pages = 15898–15903 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1508380112 | pmid=26578815 | pmc=4702990}}</ref>

==Methods to study the proteome==
{{Main article|Proteomics}}

Numerous methods are available to study proteins, sets of proteins, or the whole proteome. In fact, proteins are often studied indirectly, e.g. using computational methods and analyses of genomes. Only a few examples are given below.

===Separation techniques and electrophoresis===
Proteomics, the study of the proteome, has largely been practiced through the separation of proteins by two dimensional [[gel electrophoresis]].  In the first dimension, the proteins are separated by [[isoelectric focusing]], which resolves proteins on the basis of charge.  In the second dimension, proteins are separated by [[Molecular mass|molecular weight]] using [[SDS-PAGE]].  The gel is dyed with [[Coomassie Brilliant Blue]] or [[silver]] to visualize the proteins.  Spots on the gel are proteins that have migrated to specific locations.

===Mass spectrometry===
[[Mass spectrometry]] has augmented proteomics.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Altelaar|first=AF|author2=Munoz, J |author3=Heck, AJ |title=Next-generation proteomics: towards an integrative view of proteome dynamics.|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=January 2013|volume=14|issue=1|pages=35–48|pmid=23207911|doi=10.1038/nrg3356}}</ref>  [[Peptide mass fingerprinting]] identifies a protein by cleaving it into short peptides and then deduces the protein's identity by matching the observed peptide masses against a [[sequence database]].  [[Tandem mass spectrometry]], on the other hand, can get sequence information from individual peptides by isolating them, colliding them with a non-reactive gas, and then cataloguing the fragment [[Ion (physics)|ion]]s produced.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mass-Spectrometry-Based Draft of the Human Proteome |url=https://www.jpt.com/literature/Mass-Spectrometry-Based-Draft-of-the-Human-Proteome |publisher=[[Nature]] }}</ref>

In May 2014, a draft map of the human proteome was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Min-Sik|title=A draft map of the human proteome|journal=Nature|volume=509|doi=10.1038/nature13302|pmid=24870542|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v509/n7502/full/nature13302.html|issue=7502|date=May 2014|pages=575–81|display-authors=etal|pmc=4403737}}</ref> This map was generated using high-resolution Fourier-transform mass spectrometry. This study profiled 30 histologically normal human samples resulting in the identification of proteins coded by 17,294 genes. This accounts for around 84% of the total annotated protein-coding genes.

===Protein complementation assays and interaction screens===
Protein fragment complementation assays are often used to detect [[protein–protein interaction]]s. The [[Two-hybrid screening|yeast two-hybrid assay]] is the most popular of them but there are numerous variations, both used ''[[in vitro]]'' and ''[[in vivo]]''.

[[File:Pre-mRNA-1ysv-tubes.png|thumb|right|A hairpin loop from a pre-mRNA. Highlighted are the [[nucleobase]]s (green) and the ribose-phosphate backbone (blue). This is a single strand of RNA that folds back upon itself.]]

'''Ribonucleic acid''' ('''RNA''') is a [[polymer]]ic molecule essential in various biological roles in [[Genetic code|coding]], [[Translation (biology)|decoding]], [[Regulatory RNA|regulation]], and [[RNA splicing|expression]] of [[gene]]s. RNA and [[DNA]] are [[nucleic acid]]s, and, along with [[lipid]]s, [[protein]]s and [[carbohydrate]]s, constitute the four major [[macromolecule]]s essential for all known forms of [[life]]. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of [[nucleotide]]s, but unlike DNA it is more often found in nature as a single-strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double-strand. Cellular organisms use [[messenger RNA]] ('''''mRNA''''') to convey genetic information (using the nitrogenous bases [[guanine]], [[uracil]], [[adenine]], and [[cytosine]], denoted by the letters G, U, A, and C) that directs synthesis of specific proteins. Many [[virus]]es encode their genetic information using an RNA [[genome]].

Some RNA molecules play an active role within cells by catalyzing biological reactions, controlling [[gene expression]], or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals. One of these active processes is [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]], a universal function where RNA molecules direct the assembly of proteins on [[ribosome]]s. This process uses [[transfer RNA]] ('''''tRNA''''') molecules to deliver [[amino acid]]s to the ribosome, where [[ribosomal RNA]] ('''''rRNA''''') then links amino acids together to form proteins.

The chemical structure of RNA is very similar to that of [[DNA]], but differs in three main ways:
* Unlike double-stranded DNA, RNA is a single-stranded molecule<ref>{{cite web | url=http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/molecules/rnamolecule/ | title =RNA: The Versatile Molecule | publisher =[[University of Utah]] | year =2015}}</ref> in many of its biological roles and has a much shorter chain of nucleotides.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chem.ucla.edu/harding/notes/notes_14C_nucacids.pdf | title =Nucleotides and Nucleic Acids | publisher =[[University of California, Los Angeles]]}}</ref> However, RNA can, by complementary base pairing, form intrastrand (i.e., single-strand) double helixes, as in tRNA.
* While DNA contains ''[[deoxyribose]]'', RNA contains ''[[ribose]]''<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=7-UKCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT386&lpg=PT386&dq=dna+contains+deoxyribose+rna+ribose#v=onepage&q=dna%20contains%20deoxyribose%20rna%20ribose&f=false | title =Analysis of Chromosomes | vauthors = Shukla RN | isbn =9789384568177| date =2014-06-30 }}</ref> (in deoxyribose there is no hydroxyl group attached to the pentose ring in the [[nucleic acid nomenclature|2']] position). These hydroxyl groups make RNA less stable than DNA because it is more prone to [[hydrolysis]].
* The complementary base to [[adenine]] in DNA is [[thymine]], whereas in RNA, it is [[uracil]], which is an [[methylation|unmethylated]] form of thymine.<ref name=Biochemistry/>

Like DNA, most biologically active RNAs, including [[mRNA]], [[tRNA]], [[rRNA]], [[snRNA]]s, and other [[non-coding RNA]]s, contain self-complementary sequences that allow parts of the RNA to fold<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tinoco I, Bustamante C | title = How RNA folds | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 293 | issue = 2 | pages = 271–81 | date = October 1999 | pmid = 10550208 | doi = 10.1006/jmbi.1999.3001 | last-author-amp = yes | postscript = . }}</ref> and pair with itself to form double helices. Analysis of these RNAs has revealed that they are highly structured.

Each [[nucleotide]] in RNA contains a [[ribose]] sugar, with carbons numbered 1' through 5'. A base is attached to the 1' position, in general, [[adenine]] (A), [[cytosine]] (C), [[guanine]] (G), or [[uracil]] (U). Adenine and guanine are [[purine]]s, cytosine and uracil are [[pyrimidine]]s. A [[phosphate]] group is attached to the 3' position of one ribose and the 5' position of the next. The phosphate groups have a negative charge each, making RNA a charged molecule (polyanion). The bases form [[hydrogen bond]]s between cytosine and guanine, between adenine and uracil and between guanine and uracil.<ref name="pmid15561141"/> However, other interactions are possible, such as a group of adenine bases binding to each other in a bulge,<ref>{{cite book|title=RNA biochemistry and biotechnology| vauthors= Barciszewski J, Frederic B, Clark C | date = 1999 | pages = 73–87 | publisher = Springer | isbn = 0-7923-5862-7 | oclc = 52403776 }}</ref>

Like other structured biopolymers such as proteins, one can define topology of a folded RNA molecule. This is often done based on arrangement of intra-chain contacts within a folded RNA, termed as [[circuit topology]].

==Synthesis==
Synthesis of RNA is usually catalyzed by an enzyme—[[RNA polymerase]]—using DNA as a template, a process known as [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. Initiation of transcription begins with the binding of the enzyme to a [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] sequence in the DNA (usually found "upstream" of a gene). The DNA double helix is unwound by the [[helicase]] activity of the enzyme. The enzyme then progresses along the template strand in the 3’ to 5’ direction, synthesizing a complementary RNA molecule with elongation occurring in the 5’ to 3’ direction. The DNA sequence also dictates where termination of RNA synthesis will occur.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nudler E, Gottesman ME | title = Transcription termination and anti-termination in E. coli | journal = Genes to Cells | volume = 7 | issue = 8 | pages = 755–68 | date = August 2002 | pmid = 12167155 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2443.2002.00563.x }}</ref>

[[Primary transcript]] RNAs are often [[Post-transcriptional modification|modified]] by enzymes after transcription. For example, a [[poly(A) tail]] and a [[5' cap]] are added to eukaryotic [[pre-mRNA]] and [[intron]]s are removed by the [[spliceosome]].

===In translation===
[[Messenger RNA]] (mRNA) carries information about a protein sequence to the [[ribosome]]s, the protein synthesis factories in the cell. It is [[genetic code|coded]] so that every three nucleotides (a [[codon]]) corresponds to one amino acid. In [[eukaryotic]] cells, once precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) has been transcribed from DNA, it is processed to mature mRNA. This removes its [[intron]]s—non-coding sections of the pre-mRNA. The mRNA is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is bound to ribosomes and [[Translation (biology)|translated]] into its corresponding protein form with the help of [[tRNA]]. In prokaryotic cells, which do not have nucleus and cytoplasm compartments, mRNA can bind to ribosomes while it is being transcribed from DNA. After a certain amount of time the message degrades into its component nucleotides with the assistance of [[ribonuclease]]s.<ref name=The_Cell/>

[[Transfer RNA]] (tRNA) is a small RNA chain of about 80 [[nucleotide]]s that transfers a specific amino acid to a growing [[polypeptide]] chain at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation. It has sites for amino acid attachment and an [[anticodon]] region for [[codon]] recognition that binds to a specific sequence on the messenger RNA chain through hydrogen bonding.<ref name=transcriptome/>

[[Ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) is the catalytic component of the ribosomes. Eukaryotic ribosomes contain four different rRNA molecules: 18S, 5.8S, 28S and 5S rRNA. Three of the rRNA molecules are synthesized in the [[nucleolus]], and one is synthesized elsewhere. In the cytoplasm, ribosomal RNA and protein combine to form a nucleoprotein called a ribosome. The ribosome binds mRNA and carries out protein synthesis. Several ribosomes may be attached to a single mRNA at any time.<ref name=The_Cell>{{cite book|title=The Cell: A Molecular Approach|edition=3rd| vauthors = Cooper GC, Hausman RE | date = 2004|pages=261–76, 297, 339–44|publisher=Sinauer|isbn=0-87893-214-3|oclc=174924833 }}</ref> Nearly all the RNA found in a typical eukaryotic cell is rRNA.

[[tmRNA|Transfer-messenger RNA]] (tmRNA) is found in many [[bacteria]] and [[plastid]]s. It tags proteins encoded by mRNAs that lack stop codons for degradation and prevents the ribosome from stalling.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gueneau de Novoa P, Williams KP | title = The tmRNA website: reductive evolution of tmRNA in plastids and other endosymbionts | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 32 | issue = Database issue | pages = D104-8 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14681369 | pmc = 308836 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkh102 }}</ref>

===In RNA processing===
[[File:Synthesis of Pseudouridine.svg|thumb|Uridine to pseudouridine is a common RNA modification.]]
Many RNAs are involved in modifying other RNAs.
[[Intron]]s are [[Splicing (genetics)|spliced]] out of [[pre-mRNA]] by [[spliceosome]]s, which contain several [[small nuclear RNA]]s (snRNA),<ref name=Biochemistry/> or the introns can be ribozymes that are spliced by themselves.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Steitz TA, Steitz JA | title = A general two-metal-ion mechanism for catalytic RNA | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 90 | issue = 14 | pages = 6498–502 | date = July 1993 | pmid = 8341661 | pmc = 46959 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.90.14.6498 | bibcode = 1993PNAS...90.6498S }}</ref>
RNA can also be altered by having its nucleotides modified to  nucleotides other than [[adenosine|A]], [[cytidine|C]], [[guanosine|G]] and [[uridine|U]].
In eukaryotes, modifications of RNA nucleotides are in general directed by [[small nucleolar RNA]]s (snoRNA; 60–300&nbsp;nt),<ref name=transcriptome>{{cite book|title=Mining the transcriptome&nbsp;– methods and applications|url=http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:10803/FULLTEXT01 | vauthors = Wirta W |date=2006|isbn=91-7178-436-5|publisher=School of Biotechnology, Royal Institute of Technology|location=Stockholm|oclc=185406288}}</ref> found in the [[nucleolus]] and [[Cajal body|cajal bodies]]. snoRNAs associate with enzymes and guide them to a spot on an RNA by basepairing to that RNA.

===RNA genomes===
Like DNA, RNA can carry genetic information. [[RNA virus]]es have [[genome]]s composed of RNA that encodes a number of proteins. The viral genome is replicated by some of those proteins, while other proteins protect the genome as the virus particle moves to a new host cell. [[Viroid]]s are another group of pathogens, but they consist only of RNA, do not encode any protein and are replicated by a host plant cell's polymerase.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Daròs JA, Elena SF, Flores R | title = Viroids: an Ariadne's thread into the RNA labyrinth | journal = EMBO Reports | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 593–8 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16741503 | pmc = 1479586 | doi = 10.1038/sj.embor.7400706 }}</ref>

===In reverse transcription===
Reverse transcribing viruses replicate their genomes by [[Reverse transcription|reverse transcribing]] DNA copies from their RNA; these DNA copies are then transcribed to new RNA.

===Double-stranded RNA===
Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is RNA with two complementary strands, similar to the DNA found in all cells. dsRNA forms the genetic material of some [[virus]]es ([[double-stranded RNA viruses]]). Double-stranded RNA such as viral RNA or [[siRNA]] can trigger [[RNA interference]] in [[eukaryote]]s, as well as [[interferon]] response in [[vertebrate]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Blevins T, Rajeswaran R, Shivaprasad PV, Beknazariants D, Si-Ammour A, Park HS, Vazquez F, Robertson D, Meins F, Hohn T, Pooggin MM | title = Four plant Dicers mediate viral small RNA biogenesis and DNA virus induced silencing | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 34 | issue = 21 | pages = 6233–46 | date = 2006 | pmid = 17090584 | pmc = 1669714 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkl886 }}

=== Circular RNA ===

Recently{{when?|date=January 2018}}, it was shown that there is a single stranded covalently closed, ''i.e.'' circular form of RNA expressed throughout the animal and plant kingdom (see [[Circular RNA|circRNA]]). circRNAs are thought to arise via a "back-splice" reaction where the [[spliceosome]] joins a downstream donor to an upstream acceptor splice site. So far the function of circRNAs is largely unknown, although for few examples a microRNA sponging activity has been demonstrated.

==Key discoveries in RNA biology==

[[File:R Holley.jpg|thumb|210px|Robert W. Holley, left, poses with his research team.]]
Research on RNA has led to many important biological discoveries and numerous Nobel Prizes. [[Nucleic acid]]s were discovered in 1868 by [[Friedrich Miescher]], who called the material 'nuclein' since it was found in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dahm R | title = Friedrich Miescher and the discovery of DNA | journal = Developmental Biology | volume = 278 | issue = 2 | pages = 274–88 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15680349 | doi = 10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.11.028 }}</ref> It was later discovered that prokaryotic cells, which do not have a nucleus, also contain nucleic acids.

The sequence of the 77 nucleotides of a yeast tRNA was found by [[Robert W.

During the early 1970s, [[retrovirus]]es and [[reverse transcriptase]] were discovered, showing for the first time that enzymes could copy RNA into DNA (the opposite of the usual route for transmission of genetic information). For this work, [[David Baltimore]], [[Renato Dulbecco]] and [[Howard Temin]] were awarded a Nobel Prize in 1975.
In 1976, [[Walter Fiers]] and his team determined the first complete nucleotide sequence of an RNA virus genome, that of [[bacteriophage MS2]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fiers W, Contreras R, Duerinck F, Haegeman G, Iserentant D, Merregaert J, Min Jou W, Molemans F, Raeymaekers A, Van den Berghe A, Volckaert G, Ysebaert M | title = Complete nucleotide sequence of bacteriophage MS2 RNA: primary and secondary structure of the replicase gene | journal = Nature | volume = 260 | issue = 5551 | pages = 500–7 | date = April 1976 | pmid = 1264203 | doi = 10.1038/260500a0 | bibcode = 1976Natur.260..500F | displayauthors = 1 }}</ref>

In 1977, [[intron]]s and [[RNA splicing]] were discovered in both mammalian viruses and in cellular genes, resulting in a 1993 Nobel to [[Philip A. Sharp|Philip Sharp]] and [[Richard J. Roberts|Richard Roberts]].
Catalytic RNA molecules ([[ribozyme]]s) were discovered in the early 1980s, leading to a 1989 Nobel award to [[Thomas Cech]] and [[Sidney Altman]]. In 1990, it was found in ''[[Petunia]]'' that introduced genes can silence similar genes of the plant's own, now known to be a result of [[RNA interference]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Napoli C, Lemieux C, Jorgensen R | title = Introduction of a Chimeric Chalcone Synthase Gene into Petunia Results in Reversible Co-Suppression of Homologous Genes in trans | journal = The Plant Cell | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 279–289 | date = April 1990 | pmid = 12354959 | pmc = 159885 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.2.4.279 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dafny-Yelin M, Chung SM, Frankman EL, Tzfira T | title = pSAT RNA interference vectors: a modular series for multiple gene down-regulation in plants | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 145 | issue = 4 | pages = 1272–81 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 17766396 | pmc = 2151715 | doi = 10.1104/pp.107.106062 }}</ref>

Fire|Andrew Fire]] and [[Craig Mello]] in 2006, and another Nobel was awarded for studies on the transcription of RNA to [[Roger Kornberg]] in the same year. The discovery of gene regulatory RNAs has led to attempts to develop drugs made of RNA, such as [[siRNA]], to silence genes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fichou Y, Férec C | title = The potential of oligonucleotides for therapeutic applications | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 24 | issue = 12 | pages = 563–70 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17045686 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibtech.2006.10.003 }}</ref>

==Evolution==
In March 2015, complex [[DNA]] and RNA [[nucleotide]]s, including [[uracil]], [[cytosine]] and [[thymine]], were reportedly formed in the laboratory under [[outer space]] conditions, using starter chemicals, such as [[pyrimidine]], an [[organic compound]] commonly found in [[meteorite]]s. Pyrimidine, like [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), is one of the most carbon-rich compounds found in the [[Universe]] and may have been formed in [[red giant]]s or in [[Cosmic dust|interstellar dust]] and gas clouds.<ref name="NASA-20150303">{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-ames-reproduces-the-building-blocks-of-life-in-laboratory|title=NASA Ames Reproduces the Building Blocks of Life in Laboratory|last=Marlaire|first=Ruth | name-list-format = vanc |date=3 March 2015|work=[[NASA]]|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>

'''Sulfuric acid''' ([[Sulfur#Spelling and etymology|alternative spelling]] '''sulphuric acid''') is a [[mineral acid]] with [[molecular formula]] [[proton|H<sub>2</sub>]][[sulfate|SO<sub>4</sub>]]. It is a colorless odorless syrupy liquid that is soluble in [[water]], in a reaction that is highly exothermic.<ref name="ds">{{cite web|url=http://www.arkema-inc.com/msds/01641.pdf|work=arkema-inc.com|title=Sulfuric acid safety data sheet|quote=Clear to turbid oily odorless liquid, colorless to slightly yellow.}}</ref> 

Its corrosiveness can be mainly ascribed to its [[strong acid|strong acidic nature]]. It is also [[hygroscopic]], readily absorbing [[water vapour]] from the [[air]].<ref name="ds"/> Sulfuric acid at even moderate [[concentration]]s is very dangerous upon contact with skin.<ref name="OA"/><ref name=TB>{{cite web|url=http://www.basf.ca/group/corporate/ca/en_GB/function/conversions:/publishdownload/content/sustainability/employees/occupational-medicine/responsible-care-files/BASF_medGuidelines_E015_Sulfuric_acid_C.pdf|title=BASF Chemical Emergency Medical Guidelines – Sulfuric acid (H2SO4)|publisher=BASF Chemical Company|date=2012|accessdate=December 18, 2014}}</ref> 

Sulfuric acid is a very important commodity chemical, and indeed, a nation's sulfuric acid production is a good indicator of its industrial strength.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chenier |first=Philip J. |title=Survey of Industrial Chemistry |pages=45–57 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=New York |year=1987 |isbn=0-471-01077-4}}</ref> It is widely produced with different methods, such as [[contact process]], [[wet sulfuric acid process]], [[lead chamber process]] and some other methods.<ref>Hermann Müller "Sulfuric Acid and Sulfur Trioxide" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. 2000 {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a25_635}}</ref>

The most common use of sufuric acid (60% of total) is for fertilizer manufacture{{cn|date=February 2018}}. It is also a central substance in the [[chemical industry]]. Principal uses include [[fertilizer]] manufacturing (and other [[mineral processing]]), [[Oil refinery|oil refining]], [[wastewater processing]], and [[chemical synthesis]]. It has a wide range of end applications including in [[drain cleaner|domestic acidic drain cleaners]],<ref name="dc"/> as an [[electrolyte]] in [[lead–acid battery|lead-acid batteries]] and in various [[cleaning agent]]s.

==Physical properties==

===Grades of sulfuric acid===
Although nearly 99% sulfuric acid can be made, the subsequent loss of {{chem|link=sulfur trioxide|SO|3}} at the boiling point brings the concentration to 98.3% acid. The 98% grade is more stable in storage, and is the usual form of what is described as "concentrated sulfuric acid". Other concentrations are used for different purposes. Some common concentrations are:<ref name="Columbia">{{cite book |chapter=Sulfuric Acid|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/sulfuric_acid.aspx|title=The Columbia Encyclopedia |edition=6th |year=2009 |accessdate=2010-03-16}}</ref><ref name="EB11">{{cite book|chapter=Sulphuric acid|title=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica]]|edition=11th|year=1910–1911|volume=26|pages=65–69}}</ref>

|}

"Chamber acid" and "tower acid" were the two concentrations of sulfuric acid produced by the [[lead chamber process]], chamber acid being the acid produced in the lead chamber itself (<70% to avoid contamination with [[nitrosylsulfuric acid]]) and tower acid being the acid recovered from the bottom of the Glover tower.<ref name="Columbia"/><ref name="EB11"/> They are now obsolete as commercial concentrations of sulfuric acid, although they may be prepared in the laboratory from concentrated sulfuric acid if needed. In particular, "10M" sulfuric acid (the modern equivalent of chamber acid, used in many [[titration]]s) is prepared by slowly adding 98% sulfuric acid to an equal volume of water, with good stirring: the temperature of the mixture can rise to 80&nbsp;°C (176&nbsp;°F) or higher.<ref name="EB11"/>

Sulfuric acid reacts with its anhydride, {{chem|SO|3}}, to form {{chem|H|2|S|2|O|7}}, called ''[[pyrosulfuric acid]]'', ''fuming sulfuric acid'', ''Disulfuric acid'' or ''oleum'' or, less commonly, ''Nordhausen acid''. Concentrations of oleum are either expressed in terms of % {{chem|SO|3}} (called % oleum) or as % {{chem|H|2|SO|4}} (the amount made if {{chem|H|2|O}} were added); common concentrations are 40% oleum (109% {{chem|H|2|SO|4}}) and 65% oleum (114.6% {{chem|H|2|SO|4}}). Pure {{chem|H|2|S|2|O|7}} is a solid with melting point of 36&nbsp;°C.

Pure sulfuric acid has a vapor pressure of <0.001 mmHg at 25&nbsp;°C and 1 mmHg at 145.8&nbsp;°C,<ref name="OEHHA">{{cite book |chapter=Sulfuric acid|url=http://oehha.ca.gov/air/chronic_rels/pdf/sulfuric.pdf|title=Determination of Noncancer Chronic Reference Exposure Levels Batch 2B December 2001|year=2001|accessdate=2012-10-01}}</ref> and 98% sulfuric acid has a <1 mmHg vapor pressure at 40&nbsp;°C.<ref name="Rhodia">{{cite web|url=http://www.rhodia.com/our_company/businesses/documents/Sulfuric_Acid_98.pdf|title=Sulfuric Acid 98%|year=2009|accessdate=2014-07-02|publisher=rhodia.com}}</ref>

Pure sulfuric acid is a viscous clear liquid, like oil, and this explains the old name of the acid ('oil of vitriol').

Commercial sulfuric acid is sold in several different purity grades. Technical grade {{chem|H|2|SO|4}} is impure and often colored, but is suitable for making fertilizer. Pure grades, such as [[United States Pharmacopeia]] (USP) grade, are used for making [[pharmaceutical]]s and [[dye]]stuffs. [[Analytical chemistry|Analytical]] grades are also available.

Nine hydrates are known, but three of them were confirmed to be tetrahydrate (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>·4H<sub>2</sub>O), hemihexahydrate (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>·{{frac|6|1|2}}H<sub>2</sub>O) and octahydrate (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>·8H<sub>2</sub>O).

[[Anhydrous]] {{Format molecular formula|H2SO4}} is a very [[Chemical polarity|polar]] liquid, having a [[dielectric constant]] of around 100. It has a high [[electrical conductivity]], caused by dissociation through [[protonation|protonating]] itself, a process known as [[autoprotolysis]].<ref name = greenwood>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw}}</ref>

:K<sub>ap</sub>(25&nbsp;°C)= [{{Format ion formula|H3SO4|+}}] [{{Format ion formula|HSO4|-}}] = {{val|2.7|e=-4}}

The comparable [[Self-ionization of water|equilibrium constant for water]], K<sub>w</sub> is 10<sup>−14</sup>, a factor of 10<sup>10</sup> (10 billion) smaller.

In spite of the viscosity of the acid, the effective [[Molar conductivity|conductivities]] of the {{Format ion formula|H3SO4|+}} and {{Format ion formula|HSO4|-}} ions are high due to an intra-molecular proton-switch mechanism (analogous to the [[Grotthuss mechanism]] in water), making sulfuric acid a good conductor of electricity. It is also an excellent solvent for many reactions.

==Chemical properties==

===Reaction with water and dehydrating property===
[[File:Sulphuric acid on a piece of towel.JPG|thumb|right|Drops of concentrated sulfuric acid rapidly decompose a piece of cotton towel by dehydration.]]
[[File:07. Дехидратациони својства на концентрирана сулфурна киселина.webm|thumb|280px|An experiment that demonstrates the dehydration properties of concentrated sulfuric acid. When concentrated sulfuric acid comes into contact with [[sucrose]], slow carbonification of the sucrose takes place. The reaction is accompanied by the evolution of gaseous products that contribute to the formation of the foamy carbon pillar that rises above the beaker.]]
Because the [[hydration reaction]] of sulfuric acid is highly [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]], dilution should always be performed by adding the acid to the [[Properties of water|water]] rather than the water to the acid.<ref>[http://www.cleapss.org.uk/attachments/article/0/SSS22.pdf?Secondary/Science/Student%20Safety%20Sheets/ Consortium of Local Education Authorities for the Provision of Science Equipment -STUDENT SAFETY SHEETS 22 Sulfuric(VI) acid]</ref> Because the reaction is in an equilibrium that favors the rapid protonation of water, addition of acid to the water ensures that the ''acid'' is the limiting reagent. This reaction is best thought of as the formation of [[hydronium]] ions:

: {{chem|H|2|SO|4}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} → {{chem|H|3|O|+}} + HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp; K<sub>1</sub> = 2.4{{e|6}} &nbsp; (strong acid)

: {{chem|HSO|4|-}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} → {{chem|H|3|O|+}} + {{chem|SO|4|2-}} &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {{chem|K|2}} = 1.0{{e|-2}}&nbsp;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/VirtTxtJml/acidity.htm |title=Ionization Constants of Inorganic Acids |publisher=.chemistry.msu.edu |accessdate=2011-05-30}}</ref>

{{chem|HSO|4|-}} is the ''[[bisulfate]]'' anion and {{chem|SO|4|2-}} is the ''[[sulfate]]'' anion. K<sub>1</sub> and K<sub>2</sub> are the [[acid dissociation constant]]s.

Because the hydration of sulfuric acid is [[thermodynamic]]ally favorable and the affinity of it for [[water (molecule)|water]] is sufficiently strong, sulfuric acid is an excellent dehydrating agent. Concentrated sulfuric acid has a very powerful [[Dehydration reaction|dehydrating]] property, removing water ([[Water|H<sub>2</sub>O]]) from other [[Chemical compound|compounds]] including [[sugar]] and other [[carbohydrate]]s and producing [[carbon]], heat, steam.

In the [[laboratory]], this is often demonstrated by mixing [[table sugar]] (sucrose) into sulfuric acid. The sugar changes from white to dark brown and then to black as carbon is formed. A rigid column of black, porous carbon will emerge as well. The carbon will smell strongly of [[caramel (aroma)|caramel]] due to the heat generated.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcpodCsTxtc Sulphuric acid on sugar cubes chemistry experiment 8. Old Version]. YouTube. Retrieved on 2011-07-18.</ref>

:<chem>\overbrace{C12H22O11}^{sucrose} ->[\ce{H2SO4}] \underset{(black~graphitic~foam)}{12C} + {11H2O}_{(g,l)}</chem>

Similarly, mixing [[starch]] into concentrated sulfuric acid will give elemental [[carbon]] and water as absorbed by the sulfuric acid (which becomes slightly diluted). The effect of this can be seen when concentrated sulfuric acid is spilled on paper which is composed of [[cellulose]]; the cellulose reacts to give a [[combustion|burnt]] appearance, the [[carbon]] appears much as soot would in a fire.
Although less dramatic, the action of the acid on [[cotton]], even in diluted form, will destroy the fabric.

:<math chem>\ce{\overbrace{(C6H10O5)_\mathit{n}}^{polysaccharide} ->[\ce{H2SO4}]}\ 6n\ce{C} + 5n\ce{H2O}</math>

The reaction with [[copper(II) sulfate]] can also demonstrate the dehydration property of sulfuric acid. The blue crystal is changed into white powder as water is removed.
:<chem>\overbrace{\underset{(blue~crystal)}{CuSO4.5H2O}}^{copper(II)~sulfate\atop hydrate}
->[\ce{H2SO4}] 
\overbrace{\underset{(white~powder)}{CuSO4}}^{Anhydrous \atop copper(II)~sulfate} + 5H2O</chem>

===Acid-base properties===
As an acid, sulfuric acid reacts with most [[base (chemistry)|bases]] to give the corresponding sulfate. For example, the blue [[copper]] salt [[copper(II) sulfate]], commonly used for [[electroplating]] and as a [[fungicide]], is prepared by the reaction of [[copper(II) oxide]] with sulfuric acid:

: CuO (s) + {{chem|H|2|SO|4}} (aq) → {{chem|CuSO|4}} (aq) + {{chem|H|2|O}} (l)

Sulfuric acid can also be used to displace weaker acids from their salts. Reaction with [[sodium acetate]], for example, displaces [[acetic acid]], {{chem|CH|3|COOH}}, and forms [[sodium bisulfate]]:

:{{chem|H|2|SO|4}} + {{chem|CH|3|COONa}} → {{chem|NaHSO|4}} + {{chem|CH|3|COOH}}

Similarly, reacting sulfuric acid with [[potassium nitrate]] can be used to produce [[nitric acid]] and a precipitate of [[potassium bisulfate]]. When combined with [[nitric acid]], sulfuric acid acts both as an acid and a dehydrating agent, forming the [[nitronium ion]] {{chem|NO|2|+}}, which is important in [[nitration]] reactions involving [[electrophilic aromatic substitution]]. This type of reaction, where protonation occurs on an [[oxygen]] atom, is important in many [[organic chemistry]] reactions, such as [[Fischer esterification]] and dehydration of alcohols.

[[File:Structure of protonated sulfuric acid.png|right|thumb|200px|Solid state structure of the [D<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>+</sup> ion present in [D<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>+</sup>[SbF<sub>6</sub>]<sup>−</sup>, synthesized by using [[deuterium|D]]F in place of HF. (see text)]]

When allowed to react with [[superacid]]s, sulfuric acid can act as a base and be protonated, forming the [H<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>+</sup> ion. Salt of [H<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>+</sup> have been prepared using the following reaction in liquid [[hydrogen fluoride|HF]]:

The above reaction is thermodynamically favored due to the high [[bond enthalpy]] of the Si–F bond in the side product. Protonation using simply [[fluoroantimonic acid|HF/SbF<sub>5</sub>]], however, have met with failure, as pure sulfuric acid undergoes [[molecular autoionization|self-ionization]] to give [H<sub>3</sub>O]<sup>+</sup> ions, which prevents the conversion of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to [H<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>+</sup> by the HF/SbF<sub>5</sub> system:<ref name="InorgChem">{{cite book

===Reactions with metals and strong oxidizing property===
Dilute sulfuric acid reacts with metals via a single displacement reaction as with other typical [[acid]]s, producing [[hydrogen]] gas and [[salt]]s (the metal sulfate). It attacks reactive metals (metals at positions above [[copper]] in the [[reactivity series]]) such as [[iron]], [[aluminium]], [[zinc]], [[manganese]], [[magnesium]] and [[nickel]].

==Occurrence==
[[File:Rio tinto river CarolStoker NASA Ames Research Center.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] with its highly acidic water]]

Pure sulfuric acid is not encountered naturally on Earth in anhydrous form, due to its great [[Hygroscopy|affinity for water]]. Dilute sulfuric acid is a constituent of [[acid rain]], which is formed by atmospheric [[Redox|oxidation]] of [[sulfur dioxide]] in the presence of [[water (molecule)|water]] – i.e., oxidation of [[sulfurous acid]]. Sulfur dioxide is the main byproduct produced when sulfur-containing fuels such as coal or oil are burned.

Sulfuric acid is formed naturally by the oxidation of sulfide minerals, such as iron sulfide. The resulting water can be highly acidic and is called [[acid mine drainage]] (AMD) or acid rock drainage (ARD). This acidic water is capable of dissolving metals present in sulfide ores, which results in brightly colored, toxic streams. The oxidation of [[pyrite]] (iron sulfide) by molecular oxygen produces iron(II), or {{chem|Fe|2+}}:

:2 {{chem|FeS|2}} (s) + 7 {{chem|O|2}} + 2 {{H2O}} → 2 {{chem|Fe|2+}} + 4 {{chem|SO|4|2-}} + 4 {{chem|H|+}}

The {{chem|Fe|2+}} can be further oxidized to {{chem|Fe|3+}}:

:4 {{chem|Fe|2+}} + {{chem|O|2}} + 4 {{chem|H|+}} → 4 {{chem|Fe|3+}} + 2 {{H2O}}

The {{chem|Fe|3+}} produced can be precipitated as the [[hydroxide]] or [[hydrous iron oxides|hydrous oxide]]:

:{{chem|Fe|3+}} + 3 {{H2O}} → {{chem|Fe|(OH)|3}}↓ + 3 {{chem|H|+}}

The iron(III) ion ("ferric iron") can also oxidize pyrite:

:{{chem|FeS|2}}(s) + 14 {{chem|Fe|3+}} + 8 {{H2O}} → 15 {{chem|Fe|2+}} + 2 {{chem|SO|4|2-}} + 16 {{chem|H|+}}

When iron(III) oxidation of pyrite occurs, the process can become rapid. [[pH]] values below zero have been measured in ARD produced by this process.

ARD can also produce sulfuric acid at a slower rate, so that the [[acid neutralizing capacity]] (ANC) of the aquifer can neutralize the produced acid. In such cases, the [[total dissolved solids]] (TDS) concentration of the water can be increased from the dissolution of minerals from the acid-neutralization reaction with the minerals.

Sulfuric acid is used as a defense by certain marine species, for example, the phaeophyte alga ''Desmarestia munda'' (order [[Desmarestiales]]) concentrates sulfuric acid in cell vacuoles.<ref name='Pelletreau'>{{cite journal|first = K.|last = Pelletreau|author2=Muller-Parker, G. |journal = Marine Biology|year = 2002|volume = 141|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1007/s00227-002-0809-6|title = Sulfuric acid in the phaeophyte alga Desmarestia munda deters feeding by the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis}}</ref>

===Stratospheric aerosol===

In the [[stratosphere]], the atmosphere's second layer that is generally between 10 and 50&nbsp;km above Earth's surface, sulfuric acid is formed by the oxidation of volcanic sulfur dioxide by the [[hydroxyl radical]]:<ref name='Kremser'>{{cite journal|first = S.|last = Kremser|author2 = Thomson, L.W.|journal = Review of Geophysics|year = 2016|volume = 54|issue = 2|pages=278–335|doi=10.1002/2015RG000511|title = Stratospheric aerosol—Observations, processes, and impact on climate}}</ref>
:{{chem|SO|2}} + HO<sup>•</sup> → {{chem|HSO|3}}
:{{chem|HSO|3}} + {{chem|O|2}} → {{chem|SO|3}} + {{chem|HO|2|}}
:{{chem|SO|3}} + {{H2O}} → {{chem|H|2|SO|4}}

Because sulfuric acid reaches [[supersaturation]] in the stratosphere, it can nucleate aerosol particles and provide a surface for aerosol growth via condensation and coagulation with other water-sulfuric acid aerosols. This results in the [[stratospheric aerosol layer]].<ref name='Kremser'></ref>

===Extraterrestrial sulfuric acid===

====Venus====
Sulfuric acid is produced in the upper atmosphere of [[Venus]] by the [[Sun]]'s [[photochemistry|photochemical]] action on [[carbon dioxide]], [[sulfur dioxide]], and [[water]] vapor. [[Ultraviolet]] [[photon]]s of wavelengths less than 169&nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]] can [[photodissociation|photodissociate]] carbon dioxide into [[carbon monoxide]] and atomic [[oxygen]]. Atomic oxygen is highly reactive. When it reacts with sulfur dioxide, a trace component of the Venusian atmosphere, the result is [[sulfur trioxide]], which can combine with water vapor, another trace component of Venus's atmosphere, to yield sulfuric acid. In the upper, cooler portions of Venus's atmosphere, sulfuric acid exists as a liquid, and thick sulfuric acid clouds completely obscure the planet's surface when viewed from above. The main cloud layer extends from 45–70&nbsp;km above the planet's surface, with thinner hazes extending as low as 30&nbsp;km and as high as 90&nbsp;km above the surface. The permanent Venusian clouds produce a concentrated acid rain, as the clouds in the atmosphere of Earth produce water rain.

The atmosphere exhibits a sulfuric acid cycle. As sulfuric acid rain droplets fall down through the hotter layers of the atmosphere's temperature gradient, they are heated up and release water vapor, becoming more and more concentrated. When they reach temperatures above 300&nbsp;°C, sulfuric acid begins to decompose into [[sulfur trioxide]] and water, both in the gas phase. Sulfur trioxide is highly reactive and dissociates into sulfur dioxide and atomic oxygen, which oxidizes traces of carbon monoxide to form carbon dioxide. Sulfur dioxide and water vapor rise on convection currents from the mid-level atmospheric layers to higher altitudes, where they will be transformed again into sulfuric acid, and the cycle repeats.

====Europa====
Infrared spectra taken by [[NASA]]'s [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'' spacecraft]] show distinct absorptions on [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] that have been attributed to one or more sulfuric acid hydrates. Sulfuric acid in solution with water causes significant [[freezing-point depression]] of water's [[melting point]], down to {{convert|210|K|°C}}, and this would make the existence of liquid solutions beneath [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]'s icy crust more likely. The interpretation of the spectra is somewhat controversial. Some planetary scientists prefer to assign the spectral features to the sulfate ion, perhaps as part of one or more minerals on Europa's surface.<ref>{{cite journal |first=T. M. |last=Orlando |first2=T. B. |last2=McCord |first3=G.

==Manufacture==
{{Main|Contact process|Wet sulfuric acid process|Lead chamber process}}

Sulfuric acid is produced from [[sulfur]], oxygen and water via the conventional [[contact process]] (DCDA) or the [[wet sulfuric acid process]] (WSA).

===Contact process===
{{main|Contact process}}
In the first step, sulfur is burned to produce sulfur dioxide.
: S (s) + {{chem|O|2}} (g) → {{chem|SO|2}} (g)

This is then oxidized to sulfur trioxide using oxygen in the presence of a [[vanadium(V) oxide]] [[catalyst]]. This reaction is reversible and the formation of the sulfur trioxide is exothermic.
: 2 {{chem|SO|2}} (g) + {{chem|O|2}} (g) {{eqm}} 2 {{chem|SO|3}} (g) (in presence of {{chem|V|2|O|5}})

The sulfur trioxide is absorbed into 97–98% {{chem|H|2|SO|4}} to form [[oleum]] ({{chem|H|2|S|2|O|7}}), also known as fuming sulfuric acid. The oleum is then diluted with water to form concentrated sulfuric acid.

: {{chem|H|2|SO|4}} (l) + {{chem|SO|3}} (g)→ {{chem|H|2|S|2|O|7}} (l)

: {{chem|H|2|S|2|O|7}} (l) + {{chem|H|2|O}} (l) → 2 {{chem|H|2|SO|4}} (l)

Note that directly dissolving {{chem|SO|3}} in water is not practical due to the highly [[Exothermic reaction|exothermic]] nature of the [[Chemical reaction|reaction]] between sulfur trioxide and water. The reaction forms a corrosive aerosol that is very difficult to separate, instead of a liquid.
: {{chem|SO|3}} (g) + {{chem|H|2|O}} (l) → {{chem|H|2|SO|4}} (l)

===Wet sulfuric acid process===
{{main|Wet sulfuric acid process}}
In the first step, sulfur is burned to produce sulfur dioxide:
: S(s) + {{chem|O|2}}(g) → {{chem|SO|2}}(g)

or, alternatively, [[hydrogen sulfide]] ({{chem|H|2|S}}) gas is incinerated to {{chem|SO|2}} gas:
: 2 {{chem|H|2|S}} + 3 {{chem|O|2}} → 2 {{chem|H|2|O}} + 2 {{chem|SO|2}} (−518&nbsp;kJ/mol)
This is then oxidized to sulfur trioxide using oxygen with [[vanadium(V) oxide]] as [[catalyst]].
: 2 {{chem|SO|2}} + {{chem|O|2}} → 2 {{chem|SO|3}} (−99&nbsp;kJ/mol) (reaction is reversible)

The sulfur trioxide is hydrated into sulfuric acid {{chem|H|2|SO|4}}:
: {{chem|SO|3}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} → {{chem|H|2|SO|4}}(g) (−101&nbsp;kJ/mol)

The last step is the condensation of the sulfuric acid to liquid 97–98% {{chem|H|2|SO|4}}:
: {{chem|H|2|SO|4}}(g) → {{chem|H|2|SO|4}}(l) (−69&nbsp;kJ/mol)

===Other methods===
Another method is the less well-known metabisulfite method, in which [[metabisulfite]] is placed at the bottom of a beaker, and 12.6 molar concentration [[hydrochloric acid]] is added. The resulting gas is bubbled through [[nitric acid]], which will release brown/red vapors. The completion of the reaction is indicated by the ceasing of the fumes. This method does not produce an inseparable mist, which is quite convenient.

:SO<sub>2</sub> + HNO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O→ H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + NO

Sulfuric acid can be produced in the laboratory by burning sulfur in air and dissolving the gas produced in a [[hydrogen peroxide]] solution.

: SO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> → H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>

Prior to 1900, most sulfuric acid was manufactured by the [[lead chamber process]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Edward M. |last=Jones |title=Chamber Process Manufacture of Sulfuric Acid |journal=Industrial and Engineering Chemistry |year=1950 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=2208–2210 |doi=10.1021/ie50491a016 }}</ref> As late as 1940, up to 50% of sulfuric acid manufactured in the United States was produced by chamber process plants.

In early to mid nineteenth century "vitriol" plants existed, among other places, in [[Prestonpans]] in Scotland, [[Shropshire]] and the [[Lagan Valley]] in County Antrim Ireland where it was used as a bleach for linen. Early bleaching of linen was done using lactic acid from sour milk but this was a slow process and the use of vitriol sped up the bleaching process.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/20852966|title=A history of lactic acid making : a chapter in the history of biotechnology|last=(Harm)|first=Benninga, H.|date=1990|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|isbn=9780792306252|location=Dordrecht [Netherland]|oclc=20852966|page=4}}</ref>

==Uses==
[[File:2000sulphuric acid.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Sulfuric acid production in 2000]]
Sulfuric acid is a very important commodity chemical, and indeed, a nation's sulfuric acid production is a good indicator of its industrial strength.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chenier |first=Philip J. |title=Survey of Industrial Chemistry |pages=45–57 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=New York |year=1987 |isbn=0-471-01077-4}}</ref> World production in 2004 was about 180 million [[tonne]]s, with the following geographic distribution: Asia 35%, North America (including Mexico) 24%, Africa 11%, Western Europe 10%, Eastern Europe and Russia 10%, Australia and Oceania 7%, South America 7%.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Davenport, William George |author2=King, Matthew J. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Sulfuric acid manufacture: analysis, control and optimization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tRAb2CniRG4C|accessdate=23 December 2011|year=2006|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-044428-4|pages=8, 13}}</ref> Most of this amount (≈60%) is consumed for fertilizers, particularly superphosphates, ammonium phosphate and ammonium sulfates. About 20% is used in chemical industry for production of detergents, synthetic resins, dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals, petroleum catalysts, insecticides and [[antifreeze]], as well as in various processes such as oil well acidicizing, aluminium reduction, paper sizing, water treatment. About 6% of uses are related to [[pigment]]s and include paints, [[Enamel paint|enamels]], printing inks, coated fabrics and paper, and the rest is dispersed into a multitude of applications such as production of explosives, [[cellophane]], acetate and viscose textiles, lubricants, non-ferrous metals and batteries.<ref>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd|page=653}}</ref>

===Industrial production of chemicals===
The major use for sulfuric acid is in the "wet method" for the production of [[phosphoric acid]], used for manufacture of [[phosphate]] [[fertilizer]]s. In this method, phosphate rock is used, and more than 100 million tonnes are processed annually. This raw material is shown below as [[fluorapatite]], though the exact composition may vary. This is treated with 93% sulfuric acid to produce [[calcium sulfate]], [[hydrogen fluoride]] (HF) and [[phosphoric acid]]. The HF is removed as [[hydrofluoric acid]]. The overall process can be represented as:

: {{chem|Ca|5|F(PO|4|)|3}} + 5 {{chem|H|2|SO|4}} + 10 {{chem|H|2|O}} → 5 {{chem|CaSO|4|·2 H|2|O}} + HF + 3 {{chem|H|3|PO|4}}

[[Ammonium sulfate]], an important nitrogen fertilizer, is most commonly produced as a byproduct from [[Coke (fuel)|coking plants]] supplying the iron and steel making plants. Reacting the [[ammonia]] produced in the thermal decomposition of [[coal]] with waste sulfuric acid allows the ammonia to be crystallized out as a salt (often brown because of iron contamination) and sold into the agro-chemicals industry.

Another important use for sulfuric acid is for the manufacture of [[aluminium sulfate]], also known as paper maker's alum. This can react with small amounts of soap on [[paper pulp]] fibers to give gelatinous aluminium [[carboxylate]]s, which help to coagulate the pulp fibers into a hard paper surface. It is also used for making [[aluminium hydroxide]], which is used at [[water treatment]] plants to [[filter (water)|filter]] out impurities, as well as to improve the taste of the [[water]]. [[Aluminium sulfate]] is made by reacting [[bauxite]] with sulfuric acid:

: 2 {{chem|Al|O|(OH)}} + 3 {{chem|H|2|SO|4}} → {{chem|Al|2|(SO|4|)|3}} + 4 {{chem|H|2|O}}

Sulfuric acid is also important in the manufacture of [[dye]]stuffs solutions.

===Sulfur–iodine cycle===
The [[sulfur-iodine cycle]] is a series of thermo-chemical processes used to obtain [[hydrogen]]. It consists of three chemical reactions whose net reactant is [[water]] and whose net products are hydrogen and [[oxygen]]. Step one of cycle is the [[Bunsen reaction]]. 
:{|
|-
| 2 {{chem|H|2|SO|4}} → 2 {{chem|SO|2}} + 2 {{chem|H|2|O}} + {{chem|O|2}} || &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; || (830&nbsp;°C)
|-
| {{chem|I|2}} + {{chem|SO|2}} + 2 {{chem|H|2|O}} → 2 HI + {{chem|H|2|SO|4}} || &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; || (120&nbsp;°C)
|-
| 2 HI → {{chem|I|2}} + {{chem|H|2}} || &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; || (320&nbsp;°C)
|}

The sulfur and [[iodine]] compounds are recovered and reused, hence the consideration of the process as a cycle. This process is [[endothermic]] and must occur at high temperatures, so energy in the form of heat has to be supplied.

The sulfur-iodine cycle has been proposed as a way to supply hydrogen for a [[hydrogen economy|hydrogen-based economy]]. It does not require [[hydrocarbons]] like current methods of [[steam reforming]]. But note that all of the available energy in the hydrogen so produced is supplied by the heat used to make it.

The sulfur-iodine cycle is currently being researched as a feasible method of obtaining hydrogen, but the concentrated, corrosive acid at high temperatures poses currently insurmountable safety hazards if the process were built on a large scale.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=D-yPCwAAQBAJ&dq=oxygen+from+sulfur-iodine+cycle+danger|title=Our Energy Future: Resources, Alternatives and the Environment|last=Ngo|first=Christian|last2=Natowitz|first2=Joseph|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2016|isbn=9781119213369|pages=418–419}}</ref>

===Industrial cleaning agent===
{{Main|Cleaning agent}}
Sulfuric acid is used in large quantities by the [[iron]] and [[steel]]making industry to remove oxidation, [[rust]] and [[Fouling|scaling]] from rolled sheet and billets prior to sale to the [[automobile]] and [[major appliances]] industry.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Used acid is often recycled using a spent acid regeneration (SAR) plant. These plants combust spent acid{{clarify|reason="What is it, exactly? Is it still the same acid, dirty, reacted, or what?"|date=February 2015}} with natural gas, refinery gas, fuel oil or other fuel sources. This combustion process produces gaseous [[sulfur dioxide]] ({{chem|SO|2}}) and [[sulfur trioxide]] ({{chem|SO|3}}) which are then used to manufacture "new" sulfuric acid. SAR plants are common additions to metal smelting plants, oil refineries, and other industries where sulfuric acid is consumed in bulk, as operating a SAR plant is much cheaper than the recurring costs of spent acid disposal and new acid purchases.

[[Hydrogen peroxide]] ({{chem|H|2|O|2}}) can be added to sulfuric acid to produce [[piranha solution]], a powerful but very toxic cleaning solution with which substrate surfaces can be cleaned. Piranha solution is typically used in the microelectronics industry, and also in laboratory settings to clean glassware.

===Catalyst===
Sulfuric acid is used for a variety of other purposes in the chemical industry. For example, it is the usual acid catalyst for the conversion of [[cyclohexanone oxime]] to [[caprolactam]], used for making [[nylon]]. It is used for making [[hydrochloric acid]] from [[salt]] via the [[Mannheim process]]. Much {{chem|H|2|SO|4}} is used in [[petroleum]] refining, for example as a catalyst for the reaction of [[isobutane]] with [[isobutylene]] to give [[isooctane]], a compound that raises the [[octane rating]] of [[gasoline]] (petrol). Sulfuric acid is also often used as a dehydrating or oxidising agent in industrial reactions, such as the dehydration of various sugars to form solid carbon.

===Electrolyte===
[[File:Acidic drain cleaner containing sulfuric acid (sulphuric acid).jpg|right|thumb|Acidic [[drain cleaner]]s usually contain sulfuric acid at a high concentration which turns a piece of [[pH paper]] red and chars it instantly, demonstrating both the strong acidic nature and dehydrating property.]]

Sulfuric acid acts as the electrolyte in [[Lead–acid battery|lead–acid batteries]] (lead-acid accumulator):

At [[anode]]:
:{{chem|Pb}} + {{chem|SO|4}}<sup>2−</sup> ⇌ {{chem|PbSO|4}} + 2 e<sup>−</sup>

At [[cathode]]:
:{{chem|PbO|2}} + 4 H<sup>+</sup> + {{chem|SO|4}}<sup>2−</sup> + 2 e<sup>−</sup> ⇌ {{chem|PbSO|4}} + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O

[[File:Acidic drain opener.JPG|right|thumb|An acidic [[drain cleaner]] can be used to dissolve grease, hair and even tissue paper inside water pipes.]]

Overall:
:{{chem|Pb}} + {{chem|PbO|2}} + 4 H<sup>+</sup> + 2 {{chem|SO|4}}<sup>2−</sup> ⇌ 2 {{chem|PbSO|4}} + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O

===Domestic uses===
Sulfuric acid at high concentrations is frequently the major ingredient in [[Drain_cleaner#Acidic_drain_openers|acidic drain cleaners]]<ref name="dc">{{cite web|url=http://www.staplesdisposables.com/uploads/products/B470FF98A27F414881DB3FE1A1116C93.pdf|title=Sulphuric acid drain cleaner |publisher=herchem.com}}</ref> which are used to remove [[lipids|grease]], [[hair]], [[tissue paper]], etc. Similar to their [[drain opener|alkaline versions]], such drain openers can dissolve fats and proteins via [[hydrolysis]]. Moreover, as concentrated sulfuric acid has a strong dehydrating property, it can remove tissue paper via dehydrating process as well. Since the acid may react with water vigorously, such acidic drain openers should be added slowly into the pipe to be cleaned.

==History==
[[File:Dalton's-sulphuric-acid.jpg|left|thumb|[[John Dalton]]'s 1808 sulfuric acid molecule shows a central [[sulfur]] atom bonded to three oxygen atoms, or [[sulfur trioxide]], the [[anhydride]] of sulfuric acid.]]
The study of [[vitriol]], a category of glassy minerals from which the acid can be derived, began in [[Classical antiquity|ancient times]]. [[Sumer|Sumerians]] had a list of types of vitriol that they classified according to the substances' color. Some of the earliest discussions on the origin and properties of vitriol is in the works of the Greek physician [[Dioscorides]] (first century AD) and the Roman naturalist [[Pliny the Elder]] (23–79 AD). [[Galen]] also discussed its medical use. Metallurgical uses for vitriolic substances were recorded in the Hellenistic alchemical works of [[Zosimos of Panopolis]], in the treatise ''Phisica et Mystica'', and the [[Leyden papyrus X]].<ref name="Karpenko">Karpenko, Vladimir and Norris, John A. (2001). [http://www.chemicke-listy.cz/docs/full/2002_12_05.pdf Vitriol in the history of Chemistry], [[Charles University in Prague|Charles University]]</ref>

[[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|Medieval Islamic era alchemists]], [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (c. 721 – c. 815 AD, also known as Geber), [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi|Razi]] (865 – 925 AD), and [[Jamal Din al-Watwat]] (d. 1318, wrote the book ''Mabāhij al-fikar wa-manāhij al-'ibar''), included vitriol in their mineral classification lists. [[Ibn Sina]] focused on its medical uses and different varieties of vitriol.<ref name="Karpenko"/>

Sulfuric acid was called "oil of vitriol" by medieval European alchemists because it was prepared by roasting "green vitriol" ([[iron(II) sulfate]]) in an iron [[retort]].  There are references to it in the works of [[Vincent of Beauvais]] and in the ''Compositum de Compositis'' ascribed to Saint [[Albertus Magnus]]. A passage from [[Pseudo-Geber]]´s ''Summa Perfectionis'' was long considered to be the first recipe for sulfuric acid, but this was a misinterpretation.<ref name="Karpenko"/>

In the seventeenth century, the German-Dutch chemist [[Johann Glauber]] prepared sulfuric acid by burning [[sulfur]] together with [[Potassium nitrate|saltpeter]] ([[potassium nitrate]], {{chem|KNO|3}}), in the presence of steam. As saltpeter decomposes, it oxidizes the sulfur to {{chem|SO|3}}, which combines with water to produce sulfuric acid. In 1736, [[Joshua Ward]], a London pharmacist, used this method to begin the first large-scale production of sulfuric acid.

In 1746 in Birmingham, [[John Roebuck]] adapted this method to produce sulfuric acid in [[lead]]-lined chambers, which were stronger, less expensive, and could be made larger than the previously used glass containers. This process allowed the effective industrialization of sulfuric acid production. After several refinements, this method, called the [[lead chamber process]] or "chamber process", remained the standard for sulfuric acid production for almost two centuries.<ref name=b1/>

Sulfuric acid created by John Roebuck's process approached a 65% concentration. Later refinements to the lead chamber process by French chemist [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] and British chemist John Glover improved concentration to 78%. However, the manufacture of some [[dye]]s and other chemical processes require a more concentrated product. Throughout the 18th century, this could only be made by [[dry distillation|dry distilling]] minerals in a technique similar to the original [[alchemy|alchemical]] processes. [[Pyrite]] (iron disulfide, {{chem|FeS|2}}) was heated in air to yield iron(II) sulfate, {{chem|FeSO|4}}, which was oxidized by further heating in air to form [[iron(III) sulfate]], Fe<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, which, when heated to 480&nbsp;°C, decomposed to [[iron(III) oxide]] and sulfur trioxide, which could be passed through water to yield sulfuric acid in any concentration. However, the expense of this process prevented the large-scale use of concentrated sulfuric acid.<ref name=b1/>

In 1831, British [[vinegar]] merchant Peregrine Phillips patented the [[contact process]], which was a far more economical process for producing sulfur trioxide and concentrated sulfuric acid. Today, nearly all of the world's sulfuric acid is produced using this method.<ref name=z1>{{cite book|author=Philip J. Chenier|title=Survey of industrial chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KlziQA-yx3gC&pg=PA28|accessdate=23 December 2011|date=1 April 2002|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-306-47246-6|pages=28–}}</ref>

==Safety==

===Laboratory hazards===
[[File:Sulfuric acid burning tissue paper.jpg|thumb|left|Drops of 98% sulfuric acid char a piece of tissue paper instantly. Carbon is left after the dehydration reaction staining the paper black.]]
[[File:Sulfuric acid 98% chemical burn.jpg|thumb|left|Superficial chemical burn caused by two 98% sulfuric acid splashes (forearm skin).]]
Sulfuric acid is capable of causing very severe burns, especially when it is at high [[concentrations]]. In common with other corrosive [[acids]] and [[alkali]], it readily decomposes [[proteins]] and [[lipids]] through [[amide hydrolysis|amide]] and [[ester hydrolysis]] upon contact with [[Tissue (biology)|living tissues]], such as [[skin]] and [[flesh]]. In addition, it exhibits a strong [[Dehydration reaction|dehydrating property]] on [[carbohydrates]], liberating extra [[heat]] and causing [[burn#By depth|secondary thermal burns]].<ref name="OA"/><ref name=TB/> Accordingly, it rapidly attacks the [[cornea]] and can induce [[blindness|permanent blindness]] if splashed onto [[eye]]s. If ingested, it damages [[internal organs]] irreversibly and may even be fatal.<ref name="ds"/>  [[Protective equipment]] should hence always be used when handling it. Moreover, its [[oxidizing|strong oxidizing property]] makes it highly corrosive to many [[metal]]s and may extend its destruction on other materials.<ref name="OA"/> Because of such reasons, damage posed by sulfuric acid is potentially more severe than that by other comparable [[strong acids]], such as [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[nitric acid]]. 
<div style="float: right; margin-left: 1.0 em">[[File:Hazard C.svg|70px]] [[File:Dangclass8.png|70px]]
</div>

Sulfuric acid must be stored carefully in containers made of nonreactive material (such as glass). Solutions equal to or stronger than 1.5&nbsp;M are labeled "CORROSIVE", while solutions greater than 0.5&nbsp;M but less than 1.5&nbsp;M are labeled "IRRITANT". However, even the normal laboratory "dilute" grade (approximately 1&nbsp;M, 10%) will char paper if left in contact for a sufficient time.

The standard first aid treatment for acid spills on the skin is, as for other [[corrosive|corrosive agents]], irrigation with large quantities of water. Washing is continued for at least ten to fifteen minutes to cool the tissue surrounding the acid burn and to prevent secondary damage. Contaminated clothing is removed immediately and the underlying skin washed thoroughly.

===Dilution hazards===
Preparation of the diluted acid can be dangerous due to the heat released in the dilution process. To avoid splattering, the concentrated acid is usually added to water and not the other way around. Water has a higher heat capacity than the acid, and so a vessel of cold water will absorb heat as acid is added.

Also, because the acid is denser than water, it sinks to the bottom.  Heat is generated at the interface between acid and water, which is at the bottom of the vessel.  Acid will not boil, because of its higher boiling point.  Warm water near the interface rises due to [[convection]], which cools the interface, and prevents boiling of either acid or water.

In contrast, addition of water to concentrated sulfuric acid results in a thin layer of water on top of the acid.  Heat generated in this thin layer of water can boil, leading to the dispersal of a sulfuric acid [[aerosol]] or worse, an [[explosion]]. 

Preparation of solutions greater than 6&nbsp;M (35%) in concentration is most dangerous, because the heat produced may be sufficient to boil the diluted acid: efficient mechanical stirring and external cooling (such as an ice bath) are essential.

Reaction rates double for about every 10 degree Celsius [[Arrhenius equation|increase in temperature]].<ref>[[Linus Carl Pauling|Pauling, L.C.]] (1988) ''General Chemistry'', Dover Publications</ref>  Therefore, the reaction will become more violent as dilution proceeds, unless the mixture is given time to cool.  Adding acid to warm water will cause a violent reaction.

On a laboratory scale, sulfuric acid can be diluted by pouring concentrated acid onto crushed ice made from de-ionized water. The ice melts in an endothermic process while dissolving the acid. The amount of heat needed to melt the ice in this process is greater than the amount of heat evolved by dissolving the acid so the solution remains cold. After all the ice has melted, further dilution can take place using water.

===Industrial hazards===
Sulfuric acid is non-flammable.

The main occupational risks posed by this acid are skin contact leading to burns (see above) and the inhalation of aerosols. Exposure to aerosols at high concentrations leads to immediate and severe irritation of the eyes, respiratory tract and mucous membranes: this ceases rapidly after exposure, although there is a risk of subsequent [[pulmonary edema]] if tissue damage has been more severe. At lower concentrations, the most commonly reported symptom of chronic exposure to sulfuric acid aerosols is erosion of the teeth, found in virtually all studies: indications of possible chronic damage to the [[respiratory tract]] are inconclusive as of 1997. Repeated occupational exposure to sulfuric acid mists may increase the chance of lung cancer by up to 64 percent.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 3479642 | volume=79 | issue=5 | title=Lung cancer mortality in workers exposed to sulfuric acid mist and other acid mists | journal=J Natl Cancer Inst | pages=911–21 | last1 = Beaumont | first1 = JJ | last2 = Leveton | first2 = J | last3 = Knox | first3 = K | last4 = Bloom | first4 = T | last5 = McQuiston | first5 = T | last6 = Young | first6 = M | last7 = Goldsmith | first7 = R | last8 = Steenland | first8 = NK | last9 = Brown | first9 = DP | last10 = Halperin | first10 = WE| year=1987 }}</ref> In the United States, the [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) for sulfuric acid is fixed at 1&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup>: limits in other countries are similar. There have been reports of sulfuric acid ingestion leading to [[vitamin B12 deficiency]] with subacute combined degeneration. The spinal cord is most often affected in such cases, but the optic nerves may show [[demyelination]], loss of [[axon]]s and [[gliosis]].

==Legal restrictions==
International commerce of sulfuric acid is controlled under the [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances|United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988]], which lists sulfuric acid under Table II of the convention as a chemical frequently used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances.<ref name=incb>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080227224025/http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/red.pdf Annex to Form D ("Red List")], 11th Edition, January 2007 (p. 4).

{{Infobox manganese}}
'''Manganese''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Mn''' and [[atomic number]] 25. It is not found as a [[free element]] in nature; it is often found in [[mineral]]s in combination with [[iron]]. Manganese is a metal with important industrial metal [[alloy]] uses, particularly in [[stainless steel]]s.

Historically, manganese is named for [[pyrolusite]] and other black minerals from the region of [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]] in Greece, which also gave its name to [[magnesium]] and the [[iron]] ore [[magnetite]]. By the mid-18th century, [[Sweden|Swedish-]][[Germanic peoples|German]] [[chemist]] [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] had used pyrolusite to produce [[chlorine]]. Scheele and others were aware that pyrolusite (now known to be [[manganese dioxide]]) contained a new element, but they were unable to isolate it. [[Johan Gottlieb Gahn]] was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, which he did by [[reduction-oxidation|reducing]] the dioxide with [[carbon]].

[[Phosphate conversion coating|Manganese phosphating]] is used for rust and corrosion prevention on [[steel]]. Ionized manganese is used industrially as [[pigment]]s of various colors, which depend on the oxidation state of the ions. The [[permanganate]]s of [[alkali metal|alkali]] and [[alkaline earth metal]]s are powerful oxidizers. Manganese dioxide is used as the [[cathode]] (electron acceptor) material in [[Zinc-carbon battery|zinc-carbon]] and [[Alkaline battery|alkaline batteries]].

In biology, manganese(II) ions function as [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] for a large variety of [[enzymes]] with many functions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Roth |first1=Jerome |last2=Ponzoni |first2=Silvia |last3=Aschner |first3=Michael|editor1-first=Lucia |editor1-last=Banci |series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences |volume=12|chapter=Chapter 6 Manganese Homeostasis and Transport|title=Metallomics and the Cell |date=2013 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-007-5560-4|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-5561-1_6}} electronic-book {{ISBN|978-94-007-5561-1}}</ref> Manganese enzymes are particularly essential in detoxification of [[superoxide]] free radicals in organisms that must deal with elemental [[oxygen]]. Manganese also functions in the oxygen-evolving complex of photosynthetic [[plants]]. While the element is a required trace mineral for all known living organisms, it also acts as a [[neurotoxin]] in larger amounts. Especially through inhalation, it can cause [[manganism]], a condition in mammals leading to neurological damage that is sometimes irreversible.

===Isotopes===
{{Main article|Isotopes of manganese}}
Naturally occurring manganese is composed of one stable [[isotope]], <sup>55</sup>Mn. Eighteen [[radioisotope]]s have been isolated and described, ranging in [[atomic weight]] from 46 [[atomic mass unit|u]] (<sup>46</sup>Mn) to 65 u (<sup>65</sup>Mn). The most stable are <sup>53</sup>Mn with a [[half-life]] of 3.7 million years, <sup>54</sup>Mn with a half-life of 312.3 days, and <sup>52</sup>Mn with a half-life of 5.591 days. All of the remaining [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives of less than three hours, and the majority of less than one minute. The primary [[decay mode]] before the most abundant stable isotope, <sup>55</sup>Mn, is [[electron capture]] and the primary mode after is [[beta decay]].<ref name="Audi" /> Manganese also has three [[meta state]]s.<ref name="Audi">{{cite journal |last=Audi|first=Georges|title=The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties|journal=Nuclear Physics A|volume=729|pages=3–128 |publisher=Atomic Mass Data Center|date=2003 |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A |last2=Bersillon |first2=O. |last3=Blachot |first3=J. |last4=Wapstra |first4=A.

Manganese is part of the [[iron]] group of elements, which are thought to be synthesized in large [[star]]s shortly before the [[supernova]] explosion. <sup>53</sup>Mn decays to <sup>53</sup>[[chromium|Cr]] with a [[half-life]] of 3.7 million years.

The most common [[oxidation state]]s of manganese are +2, +3, +4, +6, and +7, though all oxidation states from −3 to +7 have been observed. Mn<sup>2+</sup> often competes with Mg<sup>2+</sup> in biological systems. Manganese compounds where manganese is in oxidation state +7, which are mostly restricted to the unstable oxide Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, compounds of the intensely purple permanganate anion MnO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup>, and a few oxyhalides (MnO<sub>3</sub>F and MnO<sub>3</sub>Cl), are powerful [[oxidation|oxidizing agents]].<ref name="Holl"/> Compounds with oxidation states +5 (blue) and +6 (green) are strong oxidizing agents and are vulnerable to [[disproportionation]].

The most stable oxidation state for manganese is +2, which has a pale pink color, and many manganese(II) compounds are known, such as [[manganese(II) sulfate]] (MnSO<sub>4</sub>) and [[manganese(II) chloride]] (MnCl<sub>2</sub>). This oxidation state is also seen in the mineral rhodochrosite ([[manganese(II) carbonate]]). Manganese(II) most commonly exists with a high spin, S = 5/2 ground state because of the high pairing energy for manganese(II). However, there are a few examples of low-spin, S =1/2 manganese(II).<ref name="Saha 1703–1708">{{cite journal|last=Saha|first=Amrita|last2=Majumdar|first2=Partha|last3=Goswami|first3=Sreebrata|title=Low-spin manganese(II) and cobalt(III) complexes of N-aryl-2-pyridylazophenylamines: new tridentate N,N,N-donors derived from cobalt mediated aromatic ring amination of 2-(phenylazo)pyridine.

The +3 oxidation state is known in compounds like [[manganese(III) acetate]], but these are quite powerful [[Redox|oxidizing agents]] and also prone to [[disproportionation]] in solution, forming manganese(II) and manganese(IV). Solid compounds of manganese(III) are characterized by its strong purple-red color and a preference for distorted octahedral coordination resulting from the [[Jahn-Teller effect]].

==History==
The origin of the name manganese is complex. In ancient times, two black minerals from [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]] (located within modern Greece) were both called ''magnes'' from their place of origin, but were thought to differ in gender. The male ''magnes'' attracted iron, and was the iron ore now known as [[lodestone]] or [[magnetite]], and which probably gave us the term [[magnet]]. The female ''magnes'' ore did not attract iron, but was used to decolorize glass. This feminine ''magnes'' was later called ''magnesia'', known now in modern times as [[pyrolusite]] or [[manganese dioxide]]. Neither this mineral nor elemental manganese is magnetic. In the 16th century, manganese dioxide was called ''manganesum'' (note the two Ns instead of one) by glassmakers, possibly as a corruption and concatenation of two words, since alchemists and glassmakers eventually had to differentiate a ''magnesia negra'' (the black ore) from ''magnesia alba'' (a white ore, also from Magnesia, also useful in glassmaking). [[Michele Mercati]] called magnesia negra ''manganesa'', and finally the metal isolated from it became known as ''manganese'' (German: ''Mangan''). The name ''magnesia'' eventually was then used to refer only to the white [[magnesia alba]] (magnesium oxide), which provided the name [[magnesium]] for the free element when it was isolated much later.<ref>{{cite web|last=Calvert|first=J.

Because it was used in glassmaking, [[Manganese(IV) oxide|manganese dioxide]] was available for experiments by alchemists, the first chemists. [[Ignatius Gottfried Kaim]] (1770) and [[Johann Glauber]] (17th century) discovered that manganese dioxide could be converted to [[permanganate]], a useful laboratory reagent.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Centaurus|volume=19|issue=4|title=The Discovery of an Element|first=E.|last=Rancke-Madsen|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0498.1975.tb00329.x|pages=299–313|date=1975|bibcode=1975Cent...19..299R}}</ref> By the mid-18th century, the Swedish chemist [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] used manganese dioxide to produce [[chlorine]]. First, [[hydrochloric acid]], or a mixture of dilute [[sulfuric acid]] and [[sodium chloride]] was made to react with manganese dioxide, later hydrochloric acid from the [[Leblanc process]] was used and the manganese dioxide was recycled by the [[Weldon process]]. The production of chlorine and [[hypochlorite]] [[bleach]]ing agents was a large consumer of manganese ores.

Scheele and other chemists were aware that manganese dioxide contained a new element, but they were not able to isolate it. [[Johan Gottlieb Gahn]] was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, by [[reduction-oxidation|reducing]] the dioxide with [[carbon]].

The invention of the [[Leclanché cell]] in 1866 and the subsequent improvement of the batteries containing manganese dioxide as cathodic [[depolarizer]] increased the demand of manganese dioxide. Until the development batteries with [[nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium]] and lithium, most batteries contained manganese. The [[zinc-carbon battery]] and the [[alkaline battery]] normally use industrially produced manganese dioxide because natural occurring manganese dioxide contains impurities.

A more progressive extraction process involves directly reducing manganese ore in a heap leach. This is done by percolating natural gas through the bottom of the heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850&nbsp;°C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150–250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of [[sulfuric acid]] and ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide to form [[iron hydroxide]] and elemental manganese. This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese. For further purification, the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility.<ref name="ManganeseRecovery">{{cite web|url=http://www.americanmanganeseinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/American-Manganese-Phase-II-August-19-2010-Final-Report-Internet-Version-V2.pdf|title=The Recovery of Manganese from low grade resources: bench scale metallurgical test program completed|date=2010|author=Chow, Norman|author2=Nacu, Anca|author3=Warkentin, Doug|author4=Aksenov, Igor|author5=Teh, Hoe|last-author-amp=yes|publisher=Kemetco Research Inc.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202065633/http://www.americanmanganeseinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/American-Manganese-Phase-II-August-19-2010-Final-Report-Internet-Version-V2.pdf|archivedate=2 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Small amounts of manganese improve the workability of steel at high temperatures by forming a high-melting sulfide and preventing the formation of a liquid [[iron sulfide]] at the grain boundaries. If the manganese content reaches 4%, the embrittlement of the steel becomes a dominant feature. The embrittlement decreases at higher manganese concentrations and reaches an acceptable level at 8%.

The best-known manganese-containing [[polypeptides]] may be [[arginase]], the [[diphtheria toxin]], and Mn-containing [[superoxide dismutase]] ([[Mn-SOD]]).<ref name="Mnzym">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0898-8838(08)60152-X|title=Manganese Redox Enzymes and Model Systems: Properties, Structures, and Reactivity|date=1998|last=Law|first=N.|volume=46|page=305|last2=Caudle|first2=M.|last3=Pecoraro|first3=V.|series=Advances in Inorganic Chemistry|isbn=9780120236466}}</ref>

Mn-SOD is the type of SOD present in eukaryotic [[mitochondria]], and also in most bacteria (this fact is in keeping with the bacterial-origin theory of mitochondria). The Mn-SOD enzyme is probably one of the most ancient, for nearly all organisms living in the presence of oxygen use it to deal with the toxic effects of [[superoxide]] ({{chem|O|2|-}}), formed from the 1-electron reduction of dioxygen. The exceptions, which are all bacteria, include ''[[Lactobacillus plantarum]]'' and related [[lactobacillus|lactobacilli]], which use a different nonenzymatic mechanism with manganese (Mn<sup>2+</sup>) ions complexed with polyphosphate, suggesting a path of evolution for this function in aerobic life.

The human body contains about 12&nbsp;mg of manganese, mostly in the bones. The soft tissue remainder is concentrated in the liver and kidneys.<ref name="Emsley2001"/> In the human brain, the manganese is bound to manganese [[metalloprotein]]s, most notably [[glutamine synthetase]] in [[astrocyte]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0165-0173(02)00234-5|title=Manganese action in brain function|date=2003 |last=Takeda |first=A.|journal=Brain Research Reviews|volume=41|issue=1|pmid=12505649|pages=79–87}}</ref>

Manganese is also important in photosynthetic [[oxygen evolution]] in [[chloroplast]]s in plants. The [[oxygen-evolving complex]] (OEC) is a part of photosystem II contained in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts; it is responsible for the terminal [[Oxygen evolution|photooxidation of water]] during the [[light reactions]] of [[photosynthesis]], and has a metalloenzyme core containing four atoms of manganese.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Umena|first=Yasufumi|last2=Kawakami|first2=Keisuke|last3=Shen|first3=Jian-Ren|last4=Kamiya |first4=Nobuo|title=Crystal structure of oxygen-evolving photosystem II at a resolution of 1.9 Å|journal=Nature|volume=473|issue=7345|pages=55–60|doi=10.1038/nature09913|pmid=21499260|date=May 2011|bibcode=2011Natur.473...55U}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Dismukes|first=G.

===Dietary recommendations===
The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for minerals in 2001. For manganese there was not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs, so needs are described as estimates for [[Adequate Intake]]s (AIs). The current AIs for manganese for women and men ages 19 and up are 1.8 and 2.3 mg/day, respectively. AI for pregnancy is 2.0 mg/day. AI for lactation is 2.6 μg/day. For children ages 1–18 years the AI increases with age from 1.2 to 2.2 mg/day for males, to 1.6 mg/day for females. As for safety, the IOM sets [[Tolerable upper intake level]]s (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of manganese the adult UL is set at 11 mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s (DRIs)<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Manganese|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/10026/chapter/12 |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Arsenic, Boron, Chromium, Chromium, Iodine, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, Nickel, Silicon, Vanadium, and Chromium|publisher= National Academy Press|year= 2001|pages=394–419|pmid=25057538|isbn=0-309-07279-4}}</ref> Manganese deficiency is rare.<ref>''See'' {{cite web|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/minerals/manganese |title=Manganese|work=Micronutrient Information Center|publisher=[[Oregon State University]] [[Linus Pauling Institute]]}}</ref>

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. For people ages 15 and older the AI is set at 3.0 mg/day. AIs for pregnancy and lactation is 3.0 mg/day. For children ages 1–14 years the AIs increase with age from 0.5 to 2.0 mg/day. The adult AIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs.<ref>{{cite web | title = Overview on Dietary Reference Values for the EU population as derived by the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies| year = 2017| url = https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf}}</ref> The EFSA reviewed the same safety question and decided that there was insufficient information to set a UL.<ref>{{citation| title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf}}</ref>

For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For manganese labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 2.0&nbsp;mg, but as of May 27, 2016 it was revised to 2.3&nbsp;mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA.<ref name="FedReg">{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-27/pdf/2016-11867.pdf |title=Federal Register May 27, 2016 Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels.

==Precautions==
Manganese compounds are less toxic than those of other widespread metals, such as [[nickel]] and [[copper]].<ref>{{cite book|pages=31 |title=Manganese|first=Heather|last=Hasan|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|date=2008|isbn=978-1-4042-1408-8 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nRmpEaudmTYC&pg=PA31}}</ref> However, exposure to manganese dusts and fumes should not exceed the ceiling value of 5&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> even for short periods because of its toxicity level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environmentwriter.org/resources/backissues/chemicals/manganese.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828211701/http://www.environmentwriter.org/resources/backissues/chemicals/manganese.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 August 2006 |title=Manganese Chemical Background |accessdate=2008-04-30 |publisher=Metcalf Institute for Marine and Environmental Reporting University of Rhode Island |date=April 2006 |df= }}</ref> <!--Manganese poses a particular risk for children due to its propensity to bind to CH-7 receptors.{{Clarify|date=September 2011}}--> Manganese poisoning has been linked to impaired motor skills and cognitive disorders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rais.ornl.gov/tox/profiles/mn.html|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|title=Risk Assessment Information System Toxicity Summary for Manganese|accessdate=2008-04-23}}</ref>

The permanganate exhibits a higher toxicity than the manganese(II) compounds. The fatal dose is about 10&nbsp;g, and several fatal intoxications have occurred. The strong oxidative effect leads to [[necrosis]] of the [[mucous membrane]]. For example, the [[esophagus]] is affected if the permanganate is swallowed. Only a limited amount is absorbed by the intestines, but this small amount shows severe effects on the kidneys and on the liver.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1136/emj.14.1.43|title=Potassium permanganate poisoning – a rare cause of fatal self poisoning|date=1997|last=Ong|first=K.

Manganese exposure in [[United States]] is regulated by the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA).<ref name="osha.gov">{{cite web|title=Safety and Health Topics: Manganese Compounds (as Mn)|url=https://www.osha.gov/dts/chemicalsampling/data/CH_250190.html|publisher=U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]}}</ref> People can be exposed to manganese in the workplace by breathing it in or swallowing it. OSHA has set the legal limit ([[permissible exposure limit]]) for manganese exposure in the workplace as 5&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> over an 8-hour workday. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 1&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> over an 8-hour workday and a short term limit of 3&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup>.

Generally, exposure to ambient Mn air concentrations in excess of 5 μg Mn/m3 can lead to Mn-induced symptoms. Increased [[ferroportin]] protein expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells is associated with decreased intracellular Mn concentration and attenuated [[cytotoxicity]], characterized by the reversal of Mn-reduced [[glutamate]] uptake and diminished [[lactate dehydrogenase]] leakage.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=20002294|last1=Yin|first1=Z.|date=2010|pages=1190–8|issue=5|volume=112|last2=Jiang|first2=H.|journal=Journal of Neurochemistry|last3=Lee|first3=E.

===Manganese in gasoline===
[[File:Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl.tif|thumb|Molecular model of [[methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl]] (MMT)]]
[[Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl]] (MMT) is a [[gasoline]] additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasolines to improve the [[octane rating]] of low octane petroleum distillates. It reduces [[Engine knocking|engine knock]] agent through the action of the [[Carbonyl|carbonyl groups]]. Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides, which damage [[exhaust valve]]s. The need for lead or manganese additives is merely historic because the modern reformation processes create fuels with increased octane ratings. Such fuels, directly or in mixture with non-reformed distillates, are universal in developed countries (0EU, Japan, etc.). In the USA, the imperative to provide the lowest price per volume on motor fuels and the lowest taxation rate, combined with lax legislation of fuel content before the year 2000, encouraged refineries to use MMT. Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped.<ref>Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (2012) [http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp151-c6.pdf 6. Potential for human exposure], in [http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/ToxProfiles/tp.asp?id=102&tid=23 ''Toxicological Profile for Manganese''], Atlanta, GA: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</ref> Many racing competitions specifically ban manganese compounds in racing fuel for carts and minibikes. MMT contains 24.4–25.2% manganese. Elevated atmospheric manganese concentrations are strongly correlated with automobile traffic density.

==Role in neurological disorders==

===Manganism===
{{Main|Manganism}}
Manganese overexposure is most frequently associated with [[manganism]], a rare neurological disorder associated with excessive manganese ingestion or inhalation. Historically, persons employed in the production or processing of manganese alloys<ref>Baselt, R. (2008) ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, pp. 883–886, {{ISBN|0-9626523-7-7}}.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1023/A:1021970120965|date=2002|author=Normandin, Louise|journal=Metabolic Brain Disease |volume=17|pages=375–87|pmid=12602514|last2=Hazell|first2=A. S.|title=Manganese neurotoxicity: an update of pathophysiologic mechanisms |issue=4}}</ref> have been at risk for developing manganism; however, current health and safety regulations protect workers in developed nations.<ref name="osha.gov" /> The disorder was first described in 1837 by British academic John Couper, who studied two patients who were manganese grinders.<ref name="Couper 1837 41–42">{{cite journal|last=Couper|first=John|title=On the effects of black oxide of manganese when inhaled into the lungs|journal=Br. Ann. Med. Pharm. Vital. Stat. Gen. Sci.|date=1837|volume=1 |pages=41–42}}</ref>

Manganism is a biphasic disorder. In its early stages, an intoxicated person may experience depression, mood swings, compulsive behaviors, and psychosis. Early neurological symptoms give way to late-stage manganism, which resembles [[Parkinson's disease]]. Symptoms include weakness, monotone and slowed speech, an expressionless face, tremor, forward-leaning gait, inability to walk backwards without falling, rigidity, and general problems with dexterity, gait and balance.<ref name="Couper 1837 41–42"/><ref name="Cersosimo 2007 340–346">{{cite journal|last=Cersosimo|first=M.

Animal experiments have given the opportunity to examine the consequences of manganese overexposure under controlled conditions. In (non-aggressive) rats, manganese induces mouse-killing behavior.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lazrishvili et al.|first1=I.|title=Manganese loading induces mouse-killing behaviour in nonaggressive rats|journal=J. Biol. Phys. Chem.|date=2016|volume=16|issue=3|pages=137–141 |doi=10.4024/31LA14L.jbpc.16.03}}</ref>

===Childhood developmental disorders===
Several recent studies attempt to examine the effects of chronic low-dose manganese overexposure on [[child development]]. The earliest study was conducted in the Chinese province of Shanxi. Drinking water there had been contaminated through improper sewage irrigation and contained 240–350&nbsp;µg Mn/L. Although Mn concentrations at or below 300&nbsp;µg Mn/L were considered safe at the time of the study by the US EPA and 400&nbsp;µg Mn/L by the [[World Health Organization]], the 92 children sampled (between 11 and 13 years of age) from this province displayed lower performance on tests of manual dexterity and rapidity, short-term memory, and visual identification, compared to children from an uncontaminated area. More recently, a study of 10-year-old children in Bangladesh showed a relationship between Mn concentration in well water and diminished IQ scores. A third study conducted in Quebec examined school children between the ages of 6 and 15 living in homes that received water from a well containing 610&nbsp;µg Mn/L; controls lived in homes that received water from a 160&nbsp;µg Mn/L well. Children in the experimental group showed increased hyperactive and oppositional behavior.<ref name="Bouchard 138–143" />

The current maximum safe concentration under EPA rules is 50&nbsp;µg Mn/L.<ref name="EPA drinking water">{{cite web|title=Drinking Water Contaminants|url=http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/index.cfm|publisher=US EPA|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref>

===Neurodegenerative diseases===
A protein called [[DMT1]] is the major transporter in manganese absorption from the intestine, and may be the major transporter of manganese across the [[blood–brain barrier]]. [[DMT1]] also transports inhaled manganese across the nasal epithelium. The proposed mechanism for manganese toxicity is that dysregulation leads to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate-mediated excitoxicity, and aggregation of proteins.

{{Infobox magnesium}}

'''Magnesium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&nbsp;'''Mg''' and [[atomic number]]&nbsp;12. It is a shiny gray solid which bears a close physical resemblance to the other five elements in the second column (group 2, or [[alkaline earth metals]]) of the [[periodic table]]: all group 2 elements have the same [[electron]] configuration in the outer electron shell and a similar crystal structure.

Magnesium is the ninth most abundant element in the universe.<ref>{{Housecroft3rd|pages=305–306}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Ash |first=Russell |title=The Top 10 of Everything 2006: The Ultimate Book of Lists |publisher=Dk Pub |date=2005 |url=http://plymouthlibrary.org/faqelements.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005083153/http://plymouthlibrary.org/faqelements.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-10-05 |isbn=0-7566-1321-3 }}</ref> It is produced in large, aging [[star]]s from the sequential addition of three [[Helium nucleus|helium nuclei]] to a [[carbon]] nucleus. When such stars explode as [[supernova]]s, much of the magnesium is expelled into the [[interstellar medium]] where it may recycle into new star systems. Magnesium is the eighth most abundant element in the [[Earth's crust]]<ref name="Abundance" /> and the fourth most common element in the Earth (after [[iron]], [[oxygen]] and [[silicon]]), making up 13% of the planet's mass and a large fraction of the planet's [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. It is the third most abundant element dissolved in seawater, after [[sodium]] and [[chlorine]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.seafriends.org.nz/oceano/seawater.htm#composition|title=The chemical composition of seawater|author=Anthoni, J Floor|date=2006|work=seafriends.org.nz}}</ref>

Magnesium occurs naturally only in combination with other elements, where it invariably has a +2 [[oxidation state]]. The free element (metal) can be produced artificially, and is highly reactive (though in the atmosphere, it is soon coated in a thin layer of oxide that partly inhibits reactivity — see [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]]). The free metal burns with a characteristic brilliant-white light. The metal is now obtained mainly by [[electrolysis]] of magnesium [[salts]] obtained from [[brine]], and is used primarily as a component in [[aluminium]]-magnesium alloys, sometimes called ''[[magnalium]]'' or ''[[magnalium|magnelium]]''. Magnesium is less dense than [[aluminium]], and the alloy is prized for its combination of lightness and strength.

Magnesium is the eleventh most abundant element by mass in the [[human body]] and is essential to all cells and some 300 [[enzymes]].<ref name=nih/> Magnesium ions interact with [[polyphosphate]] compounds such as [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[DNA]], and [[RNA]]. Hundreds of enzymes require magnesium ions to function.  Magnesium compounds are used medicinally as common [[laxatives]], [[antacids]] (e.g., milk of magnesia), and to stabilize abnormal nerve excitation or blood vessel spasm in such conditions as [[eclampsia]].<ref name=nih/>

== Characteristics ==

=== Physical properties ===
Elemental magnesium is a gray-white lightweight metal, two-thirds the density of aluminium. It [[tarnish]]es slightly when exposed to air, although, unlike the other [[alkaline earth metals]], an oxygen-free environment is unnecessary for storage because magnesium is protected by a thin layer of oxide that is fairly impermeable and difficult to remove. Magnesium has the lowest melting ({{convert|923|K|°F}}) and the lowest boiling point {{convert|1363|K|°F}} of all the alkaline earth metals.

Magnesium reacts with water at room temperature, though it reacts much more slowly than calcium, a similar group 2 metal.  When submerged in water, [[hydrogen]] bubbles form slowly on the surface of the metal—though, if powdered, it reacts much more rapidly. The reaction occurs faster with higher temperatures (see [[Magnesium#Safety precautions|safety precautions]]). Magnesium's reversible reaction with water can be harnessed to store energy and run a [[Magnesium injection cycle|magnesium-based engine]].

Magnesium also reacts exothermically with most acids such as [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl), producing the metal chloride and hydrogen gas, similar to the HCl reaction with aluminium, zinc, and many other metals.

=== Chemical properties ===

====Flammability====
Magnesium is highly [[flammability|flammable]], especially when powdered or shaved into thin strips, though it is difficult to ignite in mass or bulk. Flame temperatures of magnesium and magnesium alloys can reach {{convert|3100|C|F|abbr=on}},<ref name="Dreizin, Edward L.; Berman, Charles H. and Vicenzi, Edward P. 2000 30">{{cite journal|title=Condensed-phase modifications in magnesium particle combustion in air|author=Dreizin, Edward L.|author2=Berman, Charles H.|author3=Vicenzi, Edward P.|last-author-amp=yes|journal=Scripta Materialia|volume=122|doi=10.1016/S0010-2180(00)00101-2|date=2000|pages=30–42|url=http://mineralsciences.si.edu/staff/pages/vicenzi/Dreizin et al Combustion%26Flame2000.pdf}}</ref> although flame height above the burning metal is usually less than {{convert|300|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name="DOE">{{cite book

This property was used in incendiary weapons during the [[firebombing]] of cities in [[World War II]], where the only practical [[civil defense]] was to smother a burning flare under dry sand to exclude atmosphere from the combustion.

Magnesium may also be used as an igniter for [[thermite]], a mixture of aluminium and iron oxide powder that ignites only at a very high temperature.

====Source of light====
When burning in air, magnesium produces a brilliant-white light that includes strong ultraviolet wavelengths. Magnesium powder ([[flash powder]]) was used for subject illumination in the early days of [[photography]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kd5cAgAAQBAJ|title=Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography|last=Hannavy|first=John|date=2013-12-16|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135873271|page=84|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3E3AQAAMAAJ|title=Scientific American: Supplement|date=1899-01-01|publisher=Munn and Company|volume=48|page=20035|language=en}}</ref> Later, magnesium filament was used in electrically ignited single-use photography [[Flash (photography)#Flashbulbs|flashbulbs]].

=== Occurrence ===
{{Category see also|Magnesium minerals}}
Magnesium is the eighth-most-abundant element in the Earth's crust by mass and tied in seventh place with [[iron]] in [[molarity]].<ref name="Abundance">{{cite journal |title=Abundance and form of the most abundant elements in Earth's continental crust |format=PDF |accessdate=15 February 2008|url=http://www.gly.uga.edu/railsback/Fundamentals/ElementalAbundanceTableP.pdf}}</ref> It is found in large deposits of [[magnesite]], [[dolomite]], and other [[mineral]]s, and in mineral waters, where magnesium ion is soluble.

Although magnesium is found in more than 60 [[mineral]]s, only [[dolomite]], [[magnesite]], [[brucite]], [[carnallite]], [[talc]], and [[olivine]] are of commercial importance.

The {{chem|Mg|2+}} [[cation]] is the second-most-abundant cation in seawater (about ⅛ the mass of sodium ions in a given sample), which makes seawater and sea salt attractive commercial sources for Mg. To extract the magnesium, [[calcium hydroxide]] is added to [[seawater]] to form [[magnesium hydroxide]] [[precipitate]].
: {{chem|MgCl|2}} + {{chem|Ca(OH)|2}} → {{chem|Mg(OH)|2}} + {{chem|CaCl|2}}

Magnesium hydroxide ([[brucite]]) is insoluble in water and can be filtered out and reacted with [[hydrochloric acid]] to produced concentrated [[magnesium chloride]].
: {{chem|Mg(OH)|2}} + 2 HCl → {{chem|MgCl|2}} + 2 {{chem|H|2|O}}
From magnesium chloride, [[electrolysis]] produces magnesium.

== Forms ==

=== Alloy ===
As of 2013, magnesium alloy consumption was less than one million tons per year, compared with 50 million tons of [[aluminum alloy]]s. Its use has been historically limited by its tendency to corrode, [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] at high temperatures, and combust.<ref name=giz />

====Corrosion====
The presence of [[iron]], [[nickel]], [[copper]], and [[cobalt]] strongly activates [[corrosion]]. Greater than a very small percentage, these metals precipitate as [[intermetallic compound]]s, and the precipitate locales function as active [[cathode|cathodic]] sites that reduce water, causing the loss of magnesium.<ref name=giz />  Controlling the quantity of these metals improves corrosion resistance. Sufficient [[manganese]] overcomes the corrosive effects of iron. This requires precise control over composition, increasing costs.<ref name=giz /> Adding a cathodic poison captures atomic hydrogen within the structure of a metal. This prevents the formation of free hydrogen gas, an essential factor of corrosive chemical processes. The addition of about one in three hundred parts [[arsenic]] reduces its corrosion rate in a salt solution by a factor of nearly ten.<ref name=giz>{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/stainless-magnesium-corrosion-monash/28856 |title=Stainless magnesium breakthrough bodes well for manufacturing industries |publisher=Gizmag.com |date=29 August 2013|author=Dodson, Brian |accessdate=29 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Birbilis | first1 = N. | last2 = Williams | first2 = G. | last3 = Gusieva | first3 = K. | last4 = Samaniego | first4 = A. | last5 = Gibson | first5 = M.

====High-temperature creep and flammability====
Research showed that magnesium's tendency to creep at high-temperatures is eliminated by the addition of [[scandium]] and [[gadolinium]]. Flammability is greatly reduced by a small amount of [[calcium]] in the alloy.<ref name=giz />

=== Compounds ===
Magnesium forms a variety of compounds important to industry and biology, including [[magnesium carbonate]], [[magnesium chloride]], [[magnesium citrate]], [[magnesium hydroxide]] (milk of magnesia), [[magnesium oxide]], [[magnesium sulfate]], and magnesium sulfate heptahydrate ([[Epsom salts]]).

=== Isotopes ===
{{main article|Isotopes of magnesium}}

Magnesium has three stable [[isotope]]s: {{chem|24|Mg}}, {{chem|25|Mg}} and {{chem|26|Mg}}. All are present in significant amounts (see table of isotopes above). About 79% of Mg is {{chem|24|Mg}}. The isotope {{chem|28|Mg}} is radioactive and in the 1950s to 1970s was produced by several nuclear power plants for use in scientific experiments. This isotope has a relatively short half-life (21 hours) and its use was limited by shipping times.

The nuclide {{chem|26|Mg}} has found application in [[isotope|isotopic]] [[geology]], similar to that of aluminium. {{chem|26|Mg}} is a [[radiogenic]] daughter product of {{chem|26|Al}}, which has a [[half-life]] of 717,000 years. Excessive quantities of stable {{chem|26|Mg}} have been observed in the [[Ca-Al-rich inclusions]] of some [[carbonaceous chondrite]] [[meteorite]]s. This anomalous abundance is attributed to the decay of its parent {{chem|26|Al}} in the inclusions, and researchers conclude that such meteorites were formed in the [[solar nebula]] before the {{chem|26|Al}} had decayed.  These are among the oldest objects in the [[solar system]] and contain preserved information about its early history.

It is conventional to plot {{chem|26|Mg}}/{{chem|24|Mg}} against an Al/Mg ratio. In an [[isochron dating]] plot, the Al/Mg ratio plotted is{{chem|27|Al}}/{{chem|24|Mg}}. The slope of the isochron has no age significance, but indicates the initial {{chem|26|Al}}/{{chem|27|Al}} ratio in the sample at the time when the systems were separated from a common reservoir.

[[File:Mg sheets and ingots.jpg|thumb|Magnesium sheets and ingots]]
[[People's Republic of China|China]] is the dominant supplier of magnesium, with approximately 80% of the world market share. China is almost completely reliant on the [[Silicothermic reaction|silicothermic]] [[Pidgeon process]] (the reduction of the oxide at high temperatures with silicon, often provided by a ferrosilicon alloy in which the iron is but a spectator in the reactions) to obtain the metal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinamagnesiumcorporation.com/our-business/magnesium-overview| publisher=China magnesium Corporation| title=Magnesium Overview|accessdate=8 May 2013}}</ref> The process can also be carried out with [[carbon]] at approx 2300&nbsp;°C:
:{{chem|2MgO|(s)}} + {{chem|Si|(s)}} + {{chem|2CaO|(s)}} → {{chem|2Mg|(g)}} + {{chem|Ca|2|SiO|4(s)}}
:{{chem|MgO|(s)}} + {{chem|C|(s)}} → {{chem|Mg|(g)}} + {{chem|CO|(g)}}

In the [[United States]], magnesium is obtained principally with the [[Dow process]], by [[electrolysis]] of fused magnesium chloride from [[brine]] and [[sea water]]. A saline solution containing {{chem|Mg|2+}} ions is first treated with [[Calcium oxide|lime]] (calcium oxide) and the precipitated [[magnesium hydroxide]] is collected:
:{{chem|Mg|2+|(aq)}} + {{chem|CaO|(s)}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} → {{chem|Ca|2+|(aq)}} + {{chem|Mg(OH)|2(s)}}

The hydroxide is then converted to a partial [[hydrate]] of [[magnesium chloride]] by treating the hydroxide with [[hydrochloric acid]] and heating of the product:
:{{chem|Mg(OH)|2(s)}} + 2 HCl → {{chem|MgCl|2(aq)}} + 2{{chem|H|2|O|(l)}}

The salt is then electrolyzed in the molten state. At the [[cathode]], the {{chem|Mg|2+}} ion is reduced by two [[electron]]s to magnesium metal:
:{{chem|Mg|2+}} + 2 {{Subatomic particle|electron}} → Mg

At the [[anode]], each pair of {{chem|Cl|-}} ions is oxidized to [[chlorine]] gas, releasing two electrons to complete the circuit:
:2 {{chem|Cl|-}} → {{chem|Cl|2}} (g) + 2 {{Subatomic particle|electron}}

A new process, solid oxide membrane technology, involves the electrolytic reduction of MgO. At the cathode, {{chem|Mg|2+}} ion is reduced by two [[electron]]s to magnesium metal. The electrolyte is [[Yttria-stabilized zirconia]] (YSZ). The anode is a liquid metal. At the YSZ/liquid metal anode {{chem|O|2-}} is oxidized. A layer of graphite borders the liquid metal anode, and at this interface carbon and oxygen react to form carbon monoxide. When silver is used as the liquid metal anode, there is no reductant carbon or hydrogen needed, and only oxygen gas is evolved at the anode.<ref name="The Use of Solid-Oxide-Membrane Technology for Electrometallurgy">{{cite journal|last1=Pal|first1=Uday B. |last2=Powell|first2=Adam C.|title=The Use of Solid-Oxide-Membrane Technology for Electrometallurgy|date=2007|bibcode=2007JOM....59e..44P|volume=59|pages=44–49|journal=JOM|doi=10.1007/s11837-007-0064-x|issue=5}}</ref> It has been reported that this method provides a 40% reduction in cost per pound over the electrolytic reduction method.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/pdfs/merit_review_2011/lightweight_materials/lm035_derezinski_2011_o.pdf|publisher=MOxST| title=Solid Oxide Membrane (SOM) Electrolysis of Magnesium: Scale-Up Research and Engineering for Light-Weight Vehicles |first=Steve| last=Derezinski |date=12 May 2011| accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref> This method is more environmentally sound than others because there is much less carbon dioxide emitted.

The United States has traditionally been the major world supplier of this metal, supplying 45% of world production even as recently as 1995. Today, the US market share is at 7%, with a single domestic producer left, US Magnesium, a [[Renco Group]] company in [[Utah]] born from now-defunct Magcorp.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/0722/044_print.html| publisher=Forbes.com| title=Man With Many Enemies| first=Nathan| last= Vardi |date=22 February 2007|accessdate=26 June 2006}}</ref>

== History ==
The name magnesium originates from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word for a district in [[Thessaly]] called [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webelements.com/magnesium/history.html |title=Magnesium: historical information |publisher=webelements.com |accessdate=9 October 2014}}</ref> It is related to [[magnetite]] and [[manganese]], which also originated from this area, and required differentiation as separate substances. See [[manganese]] for this history.

In 1618, a farmer at Epsom in England attempted to give his cows water from a well there. The cows refused to drink because of the water's bitter taste, but the farmer noticed that the water seemed to heal scratches and rashes. The substance became known as [[Magnesium sulfate|Epsom salts]] and its fame spread.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ainsworth|first1=Steve|title=Epsom's deep bath|journal=Nurse Prescribing|date=June 1, 2013|volume=11|issue=6|page=269|accessdate=13 February 2018}}</ref> It was eventually recognized as hydrated magnesium sulfate, {{chem|MgSO|4}}·7{{hsp}}{{chem|H|2|O}}.

The metal itself was first isolated by [[Humphry Davy|Sir Humphry Davy]] in England in 1808. He used electrolysis on a mixture of magnesia and [[Mercury(II) oxide|mercuric oxide]].<ref name="Davy1808">{{cite journal| last = Davy | first = H. | date= 1808 | title =  Electro-chemical researches on the decomposition of the earths; with observations on the metals obtained from the alkaline earths, and on the amalgam procured from ammonia | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume = 98 | pages = 333–370|bibcode = 1808RSPT...98..333D | jstor=107302 | doi=10.1098/rstl.1808.0023| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gpwEAAAAYAAJ&pg=102#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> [[Antoine Bussy]] prepared it in coherent form in 1831. Davy's first suggestion for a name was magnium,<ref name="Davy1808" /> but the name magnesium is now used.

Historically, magnesium was one of the main aerospace construction metals and was used for German military aircraft as early as World War I and extensively for German aircraft in World War II.

The Germans coined the name "[[Elektron (alloy)|Elektron]]" for magnesium alloy, a term which is still used today. In the commercial aerospace industry, magnesium was generally restricted to engine-related components, due fire and corrosion hazards. Currently, magnesium alloy use in aerospace is increasing, driven by the importance of fuel economy.<ref>{{cite journal |doi= 10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.350-351.19 |title= Magnesium Alloys Development towards the 21st Century |date= 2000 |last1= Aghion |first1= E. |last2= Bronfin |first2= B. |journal= Materials Science Forum |volume= 350–351 |pages= 19–30}}</ref> Development and testing of new magnesium alloys continues, notably Elektron 21, which (in test) has proved suitable for aerospace engine, internal, and airframe components.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bronfin|first1=B.|display-authors=etal|editor=Kainer, Karl|title=Magnesium: Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Magnesium Alloys and Their Applications|date=2007|publisher=Wiley|location=Weinheim, Germany|isbn=978-3-527-31764-6|page=23|chapter=Elektron 21 specification}}</ref> The European Community runs three R&D magnesium projects in the Aerospace priority of Six Framework Program.

[[File:Burning Magnesium Block!.ogv|thumb|right|Magnesium block heated with [[blow torch|blowtorch]] to self-combustion, emitting intense white light]]

Magnesium metal and its alloys can be explosive hazards; they are highly flammable in their pure form when molten or in powder or ribbon form. Burning or molten magnesium reacts violently with water. When working with powdered magnesium, [[safety glasses]] with [[eye protection]] and UV filters (such as welders use) are employed because burning magnesium produces [[ultraviolet]] light that can permanently damage the [[retina]] of a human eye.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edu.gov.mb.ca/k12/docs/support/scisafe/chapter8.html |title=Science Safety: Chapter 8 |publisher=Government of Manitoba |accessdate=21 August 2007}}</ref>

Magnesium is capable of reducing [[water (molecule)|water]] and releasing highly flammable [[hydrogen]] gas:<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/Mg/chem.html| title=Chemistry : Periodic Table : magnesium : chemical reaction data| accessdate=26 June 2006| publisher=webelements.com}}</ref>

:Mg (s) + 2 {{chem|H|2|O}} (l) → [[Magnesium hydroxide|{{chem|Mg(OH)|2}}]] (s) + {{chem|H|2}} (g)

Therefore, water cannot extinguish magnesium fires. The hydrogen gas produced intensifies the fire. Dry sand is an effective smothering agent, but only on relatively level and flat surfaces.

Magnesium reacts with [[carbon dioxide]] exothermically to form [[magnesium oxide]] and [[carbon]]:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/demos/main_pages/9.8.html |title=Magnesium Burns in Dry Ice (CO2 Saturated) Environment |accessdate=2016-06-15}}</ref>

:2 Mg + {{chem|CO|2}} → 2 MgO + C (s)

Hence, carbon dioxide fuels rather than extinguishes magnesium fires.

Burning magnesium can be quenched by using a [[Fire extinguisher#Class D|Class D]] dry chemical fire extinguisher, or by covering the fire with [[sand]] or magnesium foundry flux to remove its air source.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cote |first=Arthur E. |date=2003 |title=Operation of Fire Protection Systems |publisher= Jones & Bartlett Learning |page=667 |isbn= 9780877655848}}</ref>

==Useful compounds==
Magnesium compounds, primarily [[magnesium oxide]] (MgO), are used as a [[refractory]] material in [[furnace]] linings for producing [[iron]], [[steel]], [[nonferrous metal]]s, [[glass]], and [[cement]].  Magnesium oxide and other magnesium compounds are also used in the agricultural, chemical, and construction industries. Magnesium oxide from [[calcination]] is used as an electrical insulator in [[Mineral-insulated copper-clad cable|fire-resistant cables]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Linsley|first=Trevor|title=Basic Electrical Installation Work|isbn=978-0-08-096628-1|page=362|date=2011|chapter=Properties of conductors and insulators}}</ref>

Magnesium reacted with an [[alkyl halide]] gives a [[Grignard reaction|Grignard reagent]], which is a very useful tool for preparing [[alcohols]].

Magnesium salts are included in various [[food]]s, [[fertilizer]]s (magnesium is a component of [[chlorophyll]]), and [[culture medium|microbe culture media]].

[[Magnesium sulfite]] is used in the manufacture of [[paper]] ([[sulfite process]]).

[[Magnesium phosphate]] is used to fireproof wood used in construction.

Magnesium hexafluorosilicate is used for moth-proofing [[textile]]s.

== Biological roles ==
{{Main article|Magnesium in biology}}

===Mechanism of action===
The important interaction between [[phosphate]] and magnesium ions makes magnesium essential to the basic [[nucleic acid]] chemistry of all cells of all known living organisms. More than 300 [[enzyme]]s require magnesium ions for their catalytic action, including all enzymes using or synthesizing [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and those that use other [[nucleotides]] to synthesize [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]. The ATP molecule is normally found in a [[Chelation|chelate]] with a magnesium ion.<ref>

===Overdose===

Overdose from dietary sources alone is unlikely because excess magnesium in the blood is promptly filtered by the [[kidney]]s,<ref name= Ayuk /> and overdose is more likely in the presence of impaired renal function. In spite of this, [[Megavitamin therapy|megadose therapy]] has caused death in a young child,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McGuire|first1=John|last2=Kulkarni|first2=Mona Shah|last3=Baden|first3=Harris|title=Fatal Hypermagnesemia in a Child Treated With Megavitamin/Megamineral Therapy|journal=Pediatrics|date=February 2000|volume=105|issue=2|pmid=10654978|url=http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/full/105/2/e18|accessdate=1 February 2017}}</ref> and severe [[hypermagnesemia]] in a woman<ref name="Kontani M, Hara A, Ohta S, Ikeda T 2005 448–452">{{cite journal |author=Kontani M|author2=Hara A|author3=Ohta S|author4= Ikeda T |title=Hypermagnesemia induced by massive cathartic ingestion in an elderly woman without pre-existing renal dysfunction |journal=Intern.

===Function in plants===
[[Plants]] require magnesium to synthesize [[chlorophyll]], essential for [[photosynthesis]]. Magnesium in the center of the [[porphyrin ring]] in chlorophyll functions in a manner similar to the iron in the center of the porphyrin ring in [[heme]]. [[Magnesium deficiency (plants)|Magnesium deficiency]] in plants causes late-season yellowing between leaf veins, especially in older leaves, and can be corrected by either applying [[epsom salts]] (which is rapidly [[Leaching (chemical science)|leached]]), or crushed [[dolomite|dolomitic]] [[limestone]], to the soil.

'''Tricalcium phosphate''' (sometimes abbreviated '''TCP''') is a [[calcium]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] of [[phosphoric acid]] with the [[chemical formula]] Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. It is also known as '''tribasic calcium phosphate''' and '''bone phosphate of lime''' ('''BPL'''). It is a white solid of low solubility.  Most commercial samples of "tricalcium phosphate" are in fact [[hydroxyapatite]].<ref name=Ullmann/>

It exists as three crystalline polymorphs α, α', and β. The α and α' states are stable at high temperatures. As mineral, it is found in [[Whitlockite]].<ref name=Ullmann>{{cite book|author1=Klaus Schrödter|author2=Gerhard Bettermann|author3=Thomas Staffel|author4=Friedrich Wahl|author5=Thomas Klein|author6=Thomas Hofmann|title=Phosphoric Acid and Phosphates|series=Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2008|publisher=Wiley-VCH|place=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a19_465.pub3}}</ref>

==Nomenclature==
{{Main article|Calcium phosphate}}
''Calcium phosphate'' refers to numerous materials consisting of calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) together with [[orthophosphate]]s (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup>), [[metaphosphate]]s or [[pyrophosphate]]s (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>4−</sup>) and occasionally oxide and [[hydroxide]] ions. Especially, the common mineral [[apatite]] has formula Ca<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>''X'', where ''X'' is [[Fluoride|F]], [[Chloride|Cl]], [[Hydroxide|OH]], or a mixture; it is [[hydroxyapatite]] if the extra ion is mainly hydroxide. Much of the "tricalcium phosphate" on the market is actually powdered [[hydroxyapatite]].

==Preparation ==

==Occurrence==
[[Calcium phosphate]] is one of the main [[combustion]] products of [[bone]] (see [[bone ash]]). Calcium phosphate is also commonly derived from [[inorganic]] sources such as mineral rock.<ref>Yacoubou, Jeanne, MS.  [http://www.vrg.org/ingredients/index.php Vegetarian Journal's Guide To Food Ingredients]  "Guide to Food Ingredients". The Vegetarian Resource Group, n.d. Web. 14 Sept. 2012.</ref>
Tricalcium phosphate occurs naturally in several forms, including:
* as a rock in [[Morocco]], [[Israel]], [[Philippines]], [[Egypt]], and [[Kola peninsula|Kola]] ([[Russia]]) and in smaller quantities in some other countries.  The natural form is not completely pure, and there are some other components like sand and lime which can change the composition.  In terms of P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, most calcium phosphate rocks have a content of 30% to 40% P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> in weight.
* in the skeletons and teeth of [[vertebrate]] animals
* in [[Milk#Cow.27s milk|milk]].

==Biphasic tricalcium phosphate, BCP==

'''Indo-1''' is a popular [[calcium indicator]] similar to [[Fura-2]].  In contrast to Fura-2, Indo-1 has a dual emissions peak. The main emission peak in calcium-free solution is 475&nbsp;nm while in the presence of [[calcium]] the emission is shifted to 400&nbsp;nm. It is widely used in [[flow cytometry]].
The penta potassium salt is commercially available and preferred to the free acid because of its higher solubility in water. While Indo-1 is not cell permeable the penta [[acetoxymethyl ester]] [[Indo-1 AM]] enters the cell where it is cleaved by intracellular [[esterases]] to Indo-1.
The synthesis and properties of Indo-1 were presented in 1985 by the group of [[Roger Y. Tsien|Roger Y Tsien]].<ref name="pmid3838314">{{cite journal

Fura-2 is excited at 340&nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]] and 380&nbsp;nm of light, and the ratio of the emissions at those wavelengths is directly related to the amount of intracellular calcium. Regardless of the presence of calcium, Fura-2 emits at 510&nbsp;nm of light. The use of the ratio automatically cancels out confounding variables, such as variable dye concentration and cell thickness, making Fura-2 one of the most appreciated tools to quantify calcium levels.

==Structure==
Calmodulin is a small, highly conserved protein that is 148 [[amino acid]]s long (16.7 [[Atomic mass unit|KDa]]). The protein has two approximately symmetrical globular [[domain (protein)|domains]] each containing a pair of EF-hand motifs (the N- and C-domain) separated by a flexible linker region for a total of four Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = Calmodulin|url = http://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/44|website = pdb101.rcsb.org|access-date = 2016-02-23}}</ref> Each [[EF hand|EF-hand]] [[structural motif|motif]] allows calmodulin to sense intracellular calcium levels by binding one Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion. Calcium ion binding regions are found in the following positions in the sequence of amino acids: 21-32, 57-68, 94-105 and 130-141; each region that calcium binds to is exactly 12 [[amino acid]]s long. These regions are located between two [[Alpha helix|alpha helices]] in the EF-hand motifs, the first two regions (21-32 and 57-68) are on one side of the linker region the other two (94-105 and 130-141) are on the other side.<ref name=":2" />

=== Importance of flexibility in calmodulin ===
Calmodulin binds such a wide variety of target proteins, making it especially important for it to have flexibility. Though Calmodulin's flexibility is more evident when it is bound to a target protein, [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] studies have shown that the linker region of Calmodulin is flexible, even when it is not bound to a target protein. Another important characteristic of calmodulin that allows it to bind a large variety of target proteins is the generic shape of the non-polar grooves in the binding sites. Since the [[non-polar]] grooves are generic, they don't require the target proteins to have any specific sequence of amino acids allowing a larger variety of target proteins to be bound. Together, these two structural characteristics of calmodulin allow it to flexibly bind [[target protein]]s with various shapes and amino acid sequences.<ref name=":0" /> For example, calmodulin binds both NMDA receptors and potassium channels which differ in length by about 50 amino acid residues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=2HQW|title=RCSB PDB                   - 2HQW: Crystal Structure of Ca2+/Calmodulin bound to NMDA Receptor NR1C1 peptide Structure Summary Page|last=M.A.|first=RCSB Protein Data Bank, Ataman, Z.A., Gakhar, L., Sorensen, B.R., Hell, J.W., Shea,|website=www.rcsb.org|access-date=2016-03-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=4QNH|title=RCSB PDB                   - 4QNH: Calcium-calmodulin (T79D) complexed with the calmodulin binding domain from a small conductance potassium channel SK2-a Structure Summary Page|last=J.F.|first=RCSB Protein Data Bank, Zhang, M., Meng, X.Y., Cui, M., Pascal, J.M., Logothetis, D.E., Zhang,|website=www.rcsb.org|access-date=2016-03-14}}</ref>

=== Similarity to troponin C ===
Calmodulin's structure is very similar to the structure of [[troponin C]] (which is another calcium binding protein). They are both members of the EFh superfamily. Troponin C, like Calmodulin, has two globular domains that are connected by a linker region.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title = Calmodulin|url = https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/f85bed6c-45d2-4b18-b868-6a2353586804/P/Ch32_Li_X_Calmodulin/Li-Calmodulin_Calmodulin.html|website = collab.itc.virginia.edu|access-date = 2016-02-23}}</ref> However, Troponin C and Calmodulin differ in the length of the linker region; the linker region of Calmodulin is smaller than that of Troponin C.<ref name=":1" /> These remarkably similar structures are an example of how the EF hand motif is highly conserved in calcium binding proteins. Though they have similar structures, their functions are very different. Troponin C has a very specific function (to elicit a [[conformational change]] in [[Troponin I]]) ultimately causing a [[Muscular contraction|contraction]] in [[skeletal muscle]]s. Calmodulin, evolved to bind a wider variety of target proteins, allowing it to play a role in many [[Physiology|physiological]] events.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

==Mechanism==

=== Overall ===
[[File:Calmodulin C-terminal.jpg|thumb|Solution structure of Calcium calmodulin C-terminal domain]]
[[File:Calmodulin N-terminal.jpg|thumb|Solution structure of Calcium-calmodulin N-terminal domain
]]
Up to four calcium ions are bound by calmodulin via its four [[EF hand]] motifs.<ref name=":0" /> EF hands supply an [[electronegative]] environment for [[ion]] coordination. After calcium binding, [[hydrophobic]] [[methyl]] groups from [[methionine]] residues become exposed on the protein via [[conformational change]]. Using both X-Ray and NMR studies, scientists were able to determine that the conformational changes occurred in the alpha-helices of the [[Ef hand motifs|EF motif]], which changes the [[binding affinity]] for target proteins. When the alpha helices are perpendicular to one another, the Calmodulin is in an open conformation giving it a higher affinity for target proteins.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Calmodulin Target Database|url = http://calcium.uhnres.utoronto.ca/ctdb/ctdb/home.html|website = calcium.uhnres.utoronto.ca|access-date = 2016-02-01}}</ref> More specifically, this conformational change presents [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] surfaces, which can in turn bind to Basic Amphiphilic Helices (BAA helices) on the target protein. These helices contain complementary [[Hydrophobicity|hydrophobic regions]]. The flexibility of calmodulin's hinged region allows the molecule to wrap around its target.<ref name=":0" /> This property allows it to tightly bind to a wide range of different target proteins. The C-domain of calmodulin has a higher affinity for calcium than does the N-domain.

=== Dynamic features ===

The [[C-terminus|C-terminal]] domain [[protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|solution structure]] is similar to the [[X-ray crystallography#Biological macromolecular crystallography|X-ray crystal structure]], while the [[EF hand]]s of the [[N-terminal]] domain are considerably less open to the X-ray crystal structure. This indicates that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding causes a larger conformational change in the N-domain than in the C-domain. The backbone flexibility within calmodulin is key to its ability to bind a wide range of targets.<ref name="pmid11685248">{{cite journal |vauthors=Chou JJ, Li S, Klee CB, Bax A | title = Solution structure of Ca(2+)-calmodulin reveals flexible hand-like properties of its domains | journal = Nat.

=== General role in the body ===
Calmodulin mediates many crucial processes such as [[inflammation]], [[metabolism]], [[apoptosis]], [[smooth muscle]] contraction, intracellular movement, [[short-term memory|short-term]] and [[long-term memory]], and the [[immune response]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Home Page for Calmodulin|url = http://structbio.vanderbilt.edu/cabp_database/general/prot_pages/calmod.html#func|website = structbio.vanderbilt.edu|access-date = 2016-02-23}}</ref><ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url = https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/potm/2003_3/Page_1.htm|title = Calmodulin|date = |access-date = 23 February 2016|website = InterPro Protein Archive|publisher = |last = McDowall|first = Jennifer}}</ref> Calcium participates in an [[Cell signaling|intracellular signaling]] system by acting as a diffusible second messenger to the initial stimuli. It does this by binding various targets in the cell including a large number of [[enzyme]]s, [[ion channel]]s, [[aquaporin]]s and other proteins.<ref name=":2" /> Calmodulin is expressed in many cell types and can have different subcellular locations, including the [[cytoplasm]], within [[organelle]]s, or associated with the [[plasma membrane|plasma]] or organelle membranes, but it is always found intracellularly.<ref name=":6" />  Many of the proteins that Calmodulin binds are unable to bind calcium themselves, and use calmodulin as a calcium sensor and signal transducer. Calmodulin can also make use of the calcium stores in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], and the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]].  Calmodulin can undergo post-translational modifications, such as [[phosphorylation]], [[acetylation]], [[methylation]] and [[proteolytic cleavage]], each of which has potential to modulate its actions.

=== Specific examples ===

==== Role in smooth muscle contraction ====
[[File:Calmodulin bound to MLC Kinase.jpg|thumb|Calmodulin bound to a peptide from MLC Kinase (2LV6.pdb)]]
Calmodulin plays an important role in [[Excitation contraction coupling|excitation contraction (EC) coupling]] and the initiation of the cross-bridge cycling in [[Smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle]], ultimately causing smooth muscle contraction.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|title = Ca(2+)-dependent phosphorylation of myosin light chain kinase decreases the Ca2+ sensitivity of light chain phosphorylation within smooth muscle cells.|url = http://www.jbc.org/content/269/13/9912|journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry|date = 1994-04-01|issn = 0021-9258|pmid = 8144585|pages = 9912–9920|volume = 269|issue = 13|language = en|first = M. G.|last = Tansey|first2 = K.|last2 = Luby-Phelps|first3 = K. E.|last3 = Kamm|first4 = J. T.|last4 = Stull}}</ref> In order to activate contraction of smooth muscle, the head of the [[myosin light chain]] must be phosphorylated. This phosphorylation is done by [[Myosin light-chain kinase|Myosin Light Chain (MLC) Kinase]]. This MLC Kinase is activated by a calmodulin when it is bound by calcium, thus making smooth muscle contraction dependent on the presence of calcium, through the binding of calmodulin and activation of MLC kinase.<ref name=":5" />

Another way that calmodulin affects muscle contraction is by controlling the movement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> across both the cell and [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] membranes. The [[Calcium channels|Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels]], such as the [[ryanodine receptor]] of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, can be inhibited by calmodulin bound to calcium, thus affecting the overall levels of calcium in the cell.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Calmodulin and the regulation of smooth muscle contraction|journal = Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry|date = 1994-06-15|issn = 0300-8177|pmid = 7816054|pages = 21–41|volume = 135|issue = 1|first = M. P.|last = Walsh|doi=10.1007/bf00925958}}</ref> Calcium pumps take calcium out of the cytoplasm and/or store it in the endoplasmic reticulum and this control helps regulate many downstream processes.

This is a very important function of calmodulin because it indirectly plays a role in every physiological process that is affected by [[Smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle]] contraction such as digestion and contraction of arteries (which helps distribute blood and regulate [[blood pressure]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Regulation of calcium channels in smooth muscle: New insights into the role of myosin light chain kinase|journal = Channels|date = 2014-10-31|issn = 1933-6950|pmc = 4594426|pmid = 25483583|pages = 402–413|volume = 8|issue = 5|doi = 10.4161/19336950.2014.950537|first = A|last = Martinsen|first2 = C|last2 = Dessy|first3 = N|last3 = Morel}}</ref>

==== Role in metabolism ====
Calmodulin plays an important role in the activation of [[phosphorylase kinase]], which ultimately leads to [[glucose]] being cleaved from [[glycogen]] by [[glycogen phosphorylase]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Nishizawa|first=Y|last2=Okui|first2=Y|last3=Inaba|first3=M|last4=Okuno|first4=S|last5=Yukioka|first5=K|last6=Miki|first6=T|last7=Watanabe|first7=Y|last8=Morii|first8=H|date=1988-10-01|title=Calcium/calmodulin-mediated action of calcitonin on lipid metabolism in rats.|journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation|volume=82|issue=4|pages=1165–1172|issn=0021-9738|pmc=442666|pmid=2844851|doi=10.1172/jci113713}}</ref>

Calmodulin also plays an important role in [[lipid metabolism]] by affecting [[Calcitonin gene-related peptide|Calcitonin]]. Calcitonin is a polypeptide hormone that lowers blood Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and activates [[G protein|G Protein]] cascades that leads to the generation of cAMP. The actions of calcitonin can be blocked by inhibiting the actions of calmodulin, suggesting that calmodulin plays a crucial role in the activation of calcitonin.<ref name=":3" />

==== Role in short-term and long-term memory ====
[[Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II]] (CaMKII) plays a crucial role in a type of synaptic plasticity called long-term potentiation (LTP) and requires the presence of calcium/calmodulin. CaMKII contributes to the [[phosphorylation]] of an [[AMPA receptor]] which increases the sensitivity of AMPA receptors.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|title = Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II and long-term potentiation enhance synaptic transmission by the same mechanism.|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date = 1995-11-21|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 40594|pmid = 7479960|pages = 11175–11179|volume = 92|issue = 24|first = P M|last = Lledo|first2 = G O|last2 = Hjelmstad|first3 = S|last3 = Mukherji|first4 = T R|last4 = Soderling|first5 = R C|last5 = Malenka|first6 = R A|last6 = Nicoll|doi=10.1073/pnas.92.24.11175}}</ref> Furthermore, research shows that inhibiting CaMKII interferes with LTP.<ref name=":4" />

'''Zinc''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Zn''' and atomic number 30. It is the first element in [[group 12 element|group 12]] of the [[periodic table]]. In some respects zinc is chemically similar to [[magnesium]]: both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state (+2), and the Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> [[ion]]s are of similar size. Zinc is the 24th most abundant [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|element in Earth's crust]] and has five stable [[isotope]]s. The most common zinc [[ore]] is [[sphalerite]] (zinc blende), a [[zinc sulfide]] mineral. The largest workable lodes are in Australia, Asia, and the United States. Zinc is refined by [[froth flotation]] of the [[ore]], [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]], and final [[extractive metallurgy|extraction]] using [[electricity]] ([[electrowinning]]).

The element was probably named by the alchemist [[Paracelsus]] after the German word ''Zinke'' (prong, tooth). German chemist [[Andreas Sigismund Marggraf]] is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by [[Luigi Galvani]] and [[Alessandro Volta]] uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. [[Corrosion]]-resistant [[galvanization|zinc plating]] of iron ([[hot-dip galvanizing]]) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in electrical [[Zinc–carbon battery|batteries]], small non-structural castings, and alloys such as [[brass]]. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as [[zinc carbonate]] and [[zinc gluconate]] (as dietary supplements), [[zinc chloride]] (in deodorants), [[zinc pyrithione]] (anti-[[dandruff]] shampoos), [[zinc sulfide]] (in luminescent paints), and zinc methyl or [[zinc diethyl]] in the organic laboratory.

Zinc makes up about 75&nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]]&nbsp;(0.0075%) of [[Earth's crust]], making it the 24th most abundant element. Soil contains zinc in 5–770&nbsp;ppm with an average 64&nbsp;ppm.

This concept is well supported by data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which illustrates that although refined zinc production increased 80% between 1990 and 2010, the reserve lifetime for zinc has remained unchanged.

For further processing two basic methods are used: [[pyrometallurgy]] or [[electrowinning]].

===Environmental impact===
Refinement of sulfidic zinc ores produces large volumes of sulfur dioxide and [[cadmium]] vapor. Smelter [[slag]] and other residues contain significant quantities of metals.

Zinc is most commonly used as an anti-[[corrosion]] agent,<ref name="Greenwood1997p1203">{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=1203}}</ref> and galvanization (coating of [[iron]] or [[steel]]) is the most familiar form. In 2009 in the United States, 55% or 893 thousand tonnes of the zinc metal was used for galvanization.<ref name="USGS-yb2006">{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/zinc/myb1-2009-zinc.pdf|title=Zinc: World Mine Production (zinc content of concentrate) by Country|work=2009 Minerals Yearbook: Zinc|publisher=United States Geological Survey|location=Washington, D.C.|date=February 2010|accessdate=June 6, 2001|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608154555/http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/zinc/myb1-2009-zinc.pdf|archivedate=June 8, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The relative reactivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient [[sacrificial anode]] in [[cathodic protection]] (CP). For example, cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe.<ref name="Lehto1968p829"/> Zinc acts as the [[anode]] (negative terminus) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline.<ref name="Lehto1968p829"/><ref group=note>Electric current will naturally flow between zinc and steel but in some circumstances inert anodes are used with an external DC source.</ref> Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=A comparative study of the electrochemical behaviour of Algerian zinc and a zinc from a commercial sacrificial anode|last=Bounoughaz|first=M.|author2=Salhi, E.|author3=Benzine, K.|author4=Ghali E.|author5=Dalard F.|journal=Journal of Materials Science|volume =38|issue=6|pages=1139–1145|doi=10.1023/A:1022824813564|date=2003|bibcode = 2003JMatS..38.1139B }}</ref> A zinc disc attached to a ship's iron rudder will slowly corrode while the rudder stays intact.<ref name=Stwertka1998p99/> Similarly, a zinc plug attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship provides temporary protection.

* The [[Reformatskii reaction]] in which α-halo-esters and aldehydes are converted to β-hydroxy-esters
* The [[Simmons–Smith reaction]] in which the carbenoid (iodomethyl)zinc iodide reacts with alkene(or alkyne) and converts them to cyclopropane
* The [[Addition reaction]] of organozinc compounds to form [[carbonyl]] compounds
* The [[Barbier reaction]] (1899), which is the zinc equivalent of the magnesium [[Grignard reaction]] and is the better of the two.  In presence of water, formation of the organomagnesium halide will fail, whereas the Barbier reaction can take place in water.
* On the downside, organozincs are much less nucleophilic than Grignards, and they are expensive and difficult to handle. Commercially available diorganozinc compounds are [[dimethylzinc]], [[diethylzinc]] and diphenylzinc.

* The [[Negishi coupling]] is also an important reaction for the formation of new carbon-carbon bonds between unsaturated carbon atoms in alkenes, arenes and alkynes. The catalysts are nickel and palladium. A key step in the [[catalytic cycle]] is a [[transmetalation]] in which a zinc halide exchanges its organic substituent for another halogen with the palladium (nickel) metal center.

In humans, the biological roles of zinc are ubiquitous.<ref name=Hambridge2007/><ref name="Zinc - brain disorders 2015 review" /> It interacts with "a wide range of organic [[ligand]]s",<ref name=Hambridge2007/> and has roles in the metabolism of RNA and DNA, [[signal transduction]], and [[gene expression]]. It also regulates [[apoptosis]]. A 2006 study estimated that about 10% of human proteins (2800) potentially bind zinc, in addition to hundreds more that transport and traffic zinc; a similar ''[[in silico]]'' study in the plant ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' found 2367 zinc-related proteins.<ref name=Broadley2007/>

Carboxypeptidase cleaves peptide linkages during digestion of proteins. A [[coordinate covalent bond]] is formed between the terminal peptide and a C=O group attached to zinc, which gives the carbon a positive charge.

===Dietary recommendations===
The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for zinc in 2001. The current EARs for zinc for women and men ages 14 and up is 6.8 and 9.4 mg/day, respectively. The RDAs are 8 and 11 mg/day. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. RDA for pregnancy is 11 mg/day. RDA for lactation is 12 mg/day. For infants up to 12 months the RDA is 3 mg/day. For children ages 1–13 years the RDA increases with age from 3 to 8 mg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets [[Tolerable upper intake level]]s (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of zinc the adult UL is 40 mg/day (lower for children). Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s (DRIs).<ref>[https://www.nap.edu/read/10026/chapter/14/ "Zinc"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919234044/https://www.nap.edu/read/10026/chapter/14/ |date=September 19, 2017 }}, pp. 442–501 in ''Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Arsenic, Boron, Chromium, Copper, Iodine, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, Nickel, Silicon, Vanadium, and Zinc''. National Academy Press. 2001.</ref>

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined the same as in United States. For people ages 18 and older the PRI calculations are complex, as the EFSA has set higher and higher values as the [[phytate]] content of the diet increases. For women, PRIs increase from 7.5 to 12.7 mg/day as phytate intake increases from 300 to 1200 mg/day; for men the range is 9.4 to 16.3 mg/day. These PRIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs.<ref>{{cite web| title = Overview on Dietary Reference Values for the EU population as derived by the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies| year = 2017| url = https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170828082247/https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf| archivedate = August 28, 2017| df = mdy-all}}</ref> The EFSA reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 25&nbsp;mg/day, which is much lower than the U.S. value.<ref>{{citation| title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160316225123/http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf| archivedate = March 16, 2016| df = mdy-all}}</ref>

Animal products (meat, fish, shellfish, fowl, eggs, dairy) contain zinc. The concentration of zinc in plants varies with the level in the soil.

Substantial responses to zinc fertilization have been reported in these areas.<ref name=Broadley2007/> Plants that grow in soils that are zinc-deficient are more susceptible to disease. Zinc is added to the soil primarily through the weathering of rocks, but humans have added zinc through fossil fuel combustion, mine waste, phosphate fertilizers, pesticide ([[zinc phosphide]]), limestone, manure, sewage sludge, and particles from galvanized surfaces. Excess zinc is toxic to plants, although zinc toxicity is far less widespread.<ref name=Broadley2007/>

===Toxicity===
Although zinc is an essential requirement for good health, excess zinc can be harmful. Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption.<ref name=Fosmire1990/> The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Contaminant Hazard Reviews |date=1993 |issue=10 |title=Zinc Hazard to Fish, Wildlife, and Invertebrates: A Synoptic Review |last=Eisler |first=Ronald |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service |location=Laurel, Maryland |url=http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/infobase/eisler/chr_26_zinc.pdf |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306032807/http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/infobase/eisler/chr_26_zinc.pdf |archivedate=March 6, 2012 |df= }}</ref> The Free Ion Activity Model is well-established in the literature, and shows that just [[mole (unit)|micromolar]] amounts of the free ion kills some organisms.

===Poisoning===
In 1982, the [[United States Mint|US Mint]] began minting [[Cent (United States coin)|pennies]] coated in copper but containing primarily zinc. Zinc pennies pose a risk of zinc toxicosis, which can be fatal. One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies (over 1&nbsp;kg of zinc) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal [[sepsis]]. Another patient who ingested 12&nbsp;grams of zinc showed only [[lethargy]] and [[ataxia]] (gross lack of coordination of muscle movements).<ref>{{cite journal

'''Norepinephrine''' ('''NE'''), also called '''noradrenaline''' ('''NA''') or '''noradrenalin''', is an [[organic compound|organic chemical]] in the [[catecholamine]] family that functions in the [[brain]] and [[human body|body]] as a [[hormone]] and [[neurotransmitter]]. The name "noradrenaline", derived from Latin roots meaning "at/alongside the kidneys", is more commonly used in the United Kingdom; in the United States, "norepinephrine," derived from Greek roots having that same meaning, is usually preferred.<ref name=BMJ>{{cite journal | vauthors = Aronson JK | title = "Where name and image meet"--the argument for "adrenaline" | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 320 | issue = 7233 | pages = 506–9 | date = Feb 2000 | pmid = 10678871 | pmc = 1127537 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.320.7233.506 }}</ref> "Norepinephrine" is also the [[international nonproprietary name]] given to the [[norepinephrine (drug)|drug]].<ref name="Norepi INN – IUPHAR">{{cite web|title=(-)-noradrenaline|url=http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?tab=summary&ligandId=505|work=IUPHAR database|publisher=International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology|accessdate=2 January 2016}}</ref> Regardless of which name is used for the substance itself, parts of the body that produce or are affected by it are referred to as '''noradrenergic'''.

In the brain, norepinephrine is produced in nuclei that are small yet exert powerful effects on other brain areas. The most important of these nuclei is the [[locus coeruleus]], located in the [[pons]]. Outside the brain, norepinephrine is used as a neurotransmitter by [[sympathetic ganglion|sympathetic ganglia]] located near the [[spinal cord]] or in the [[abdomen]], and it is also released directly into the bloodstream by the [[adrenal gland]]s. Regardless of how and where it is released, norepinephrine acts on target cells by binding to and activating [[noradrenergic receptor]]s located on the cell surface.

The general function of norepinephrine is to mobilize the brain and body for action.  Norepinephrine release is lowest during sleep, rises during wakefulness, and reaches much higher levels during situations of stress or danger, in the so-called [[fight-or-flight response]]. In the brain, norepinephrine increases arousal and alertness, promotes vigilance, enhances formation and retrieval of memory, and focuses attention; it also increases restlessness and anxiety. In the rest of the body, norepinephrine increases [[heart rate]] and [[blood pressure]], triggers the release of [[glucose]] from energy stores, increases [[blood flow]] to [[skeletal muscle]], reduces blood flow to the gastrointestinal system, and inhibits voiding of the bladder and [[gastrointestinal motility]].

A variety of medically important drugs work by altering the actions of norepinephrine systems.  [[Norepinephrine (drug)|Norepinephrine]] itself is widely used as an injectable drug for the treatment of critically low blood pressure.  [[Beta blocker]]s, which counter some of the effects of norepinephrine, are frequently used to treat [[glaucoma]], [[migraine]], and a range of cardiovascular problems.  [[Alpha blocker]]s, which counter a different set of norepinephrine effects, are used to treat several cardiovascular and psychiatric conditions.  [[Alpha-adrenergic receptor|Alpha-2 agonists]] often have a sedating effect, and are commonly used as anesthesia-enhancers in surgery, as well as in treatment of drug or alcohol dependence. Many important psychiatric drugs exert strong effects on norepinephrine systems in the brain, resulting in side-effects that may be helpful or harmful.

===Biosynthesis===

{{Catecholamine and trace amine biosynthesis|align=right|caption=Norepinephrine is synthesized from dopamine in the human body by the [[dopamine β-hydroxylase]] (DBH) [[enzyme]].}}
Norepinephrine is [[biosynthesis|synthesized]] from the [[amino acid]] [[tyrosine]] by a series of enzymatic steps in the [[adrenal medulla]] and [[postganglionic neuron]]s of the [[sympathetic nervous system]]. While the conversion of tyrosine to dopamine occurs predominantly in the cytoplasm, the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine by [[dopamine β-monooxygenase]] occurs predominantly inside [[synaptic vesicle|neurotransmitter vesicles]].<ref name=Musacchio/> The [[metabolic pathway]] is:

:Phenylalanine → Tyrosine → L-DOPA → Dopamine → Norepinephrine<ref name=Musacchio/>

Thus the direct precursor of norepinephrine is [[dopamine]], which is synthesized indirectly from the essential amino acid [[phenylalanine]] or the non-essential amino acid [[tyrosine]].<ref name=Musacchio/> These amino acids are found in nearly every protein and, as such, are provided by ingestion of protein-containing food, with tyrosine being the most common.

Phenylalanine is converted into tyrosine by the enzyme [[phenylalanine hydroxylase]], with molecular [[oxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) and [[tetrahydrobiopterin]] as [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]].  Tyrosine is converted into [[L-DOPA]] by the enzyme [[tyrosine hydroxylase]], with [[tetrahydrobiopterin]], O<sub>2</sub>, and probably [[ferrous|ferrous iron]] (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) as cofactors.<ref name=Musacchio>{{cite book |title=Biochemistry of Biogenic Amines |chapter=Chapter 1: Enzymes involved in the biosynthesis and degradation of catecholamines | vauthors= Musacchio JM | veditors = Iverson L |publisher=Springer |isbn=1-4684-3171-4 |year=2013 |pages=1–35}}</ref> L-DOPA is converted into dopamine by the enzyme [[aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase|aromatic <small>L</small>-amino acid decarboxylase]] (also known as DOPA decarboxylase), with [[pyridoxal phosphate]] as a cofactor.<ref name=Musacchio/> Dopamine is then converted into norepinephrine by the enzyme [[dopamine beta-monooxygenase|dopamine β-monooxygenase]] (formerly known as ''dopamine β-hydroxylase''), with O<sub>2</sub> and [[ascorbic acid]] as cofactors.<ref name=Musacchio/>

Norepinephrine itself can further be converted into [[epinephrine]] by the enzyme [[phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase|phenylethanolamine ''N''-methyltransferase]] with [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl-<small>L</small>-methionine]] as cofactor.<ref name=Musacchio/>

=== Degradation ===

In mammals, norepinephrine is rapidly degraded to various [[metabolite]]s. The initial step in the breakdown can be catalyzed by either of the enzymes [[monoamine oxidase]] (mainly [[monoamine oxidase A]]) or [[catechol-O-methyl transferase|COMT]].<ref name="Foye's">{{cite book | editor-last3 = Zito | editor-first3 = S.

Like many other biologically active substances, norepinephrine exerts its effects by binding to and activating [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] located on the surface of cells. Two broad families of norepinephrine receptors have been identified, known as alpha and beta adrenergic receptors.<ref name=Rang&Dale/>  Alpha receptors are divided into subtypes [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>]] and [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2</sub>]]; beta receptors into subtypes [[Beta-1 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>1</sub>]], [[Beta-2 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>2</sub>]], and [[Beta-3 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>3</sub>]].<ref name=Rang&Dale/> All of these function as [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s, meaning that they exert their effects via a complex [[second messenger system]].<ref name=Rang&Dale/> Alpha-2 receptors usually have inhibitory effects, but many are located pre-synaptically (i.e., on the surface of the cells that release norepinephrine), so the net effect of alpha-2 activation is often a decrease in the amount of norepinephrine released.<ref name=Rang&Dale/>  Alpha-1 receptors and all three types of beta receptors usually have excitatory effects.<ref name=Rang&Dale/>

====Storage, release, and reuptake====

[[File:Synapse noradrenergique1.png|thumb|right|400px|Norepinephrine (labeled "noradrenaline" in this drawing) processing in a synapse.  After release norepinephrine can either be taken up again by the presynaptic terminal, or broken down by enzymes.|alt=Cartoon diagram of a noradrenergic synapse, showing the synthetic and metabolic mechanisms as well as the things that can happen after release.]]
Inside the brain norepinephrine functions as a [[neurotransmitter]], and is controlled by a set of mechanisms common to all [[monoamine neurotransmitter]]s. After synthesis, norepinephrine is transported from the [[cytosol]] into [[vesicle (biology and chemistry)|synaptic vesicles]] by the [[vesicular monoamine transporter]] (VMAT).<ref name=Eiden>{{cite journal | vauthors = Eiden LE, Schäfer MK, Weihe E, Schütz B | title = The vesicular amine transporter family (SLC18): amine/proton antiporters required for vesicular accumulation and regulated exocytotic secretion of monoamines and acetylcholine | journal = Pflugers Arch. | volume = 447 | issue = 5 | pages = 636–40  | year=2004 | pmid = 12827358 | doi = 10.1007/s00424-003-1100-5 }}</ref> Norepinephrine is stored in these vesicles until it is ejected into the [[chemical synapse|synaptic cleft]], typically after an [[action potential]] causes the vesicles to release their contents directly into the [[chemical synapse|synaptic cleft]] through a process called [[exocytosis]].<ref name=Rang&Dale/>

Once in the synapse, norepinephrine binds to and activates receptors.  After an action potential, the norepinephrine molecules quickly become unbound from their receptors. They are then absorbed back into the presynaptic cell, via [[reuptake]] mediated primarily by the [[norepinephrine transporter]] (NET).<ref name=Torres>{{cite journal | vauthors=Torres GE, Gainetdinov RR, Caron MG | title=Plasma membrane monoamine transporters: structure, regulation and function | journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume=4 | issue=1 | pages=13–25 | year=2003 | pmid =12511858 | doi=10.1038/nrn1008 }}</ref> Once back in the cytosol, norepinephrine can either be broken down by [[monoamine oxidase]] or repackaged into vesicles by VMAT, making it available for future release.<ref name=Eiden/>

=== Sympathetic nervous system ===
{{main article|Sympathetic nervous system}}
[[File:Blausen 0838 Sympathetic Innervation.png|thumb|400px|Schema of the sympathetic nervous system, showing the sympathetic ganglia and the parts of the body to which they connect.]]
Norepinephrine is the main neurotransmitter used by the sympathetic nervous system, which consists of about two dozen [[sympathetic chain ganglia]] located next to the spinal cord, plus a set of [[prevertebral ganglia]] located in the chest and abdomen.<ref name=Hamill>{{cite book |title=Primer on the Autonomic Nervous System |chapter=Peripheral Autonomic Nervous System| authors=Hamill RW, Shapiro RE, Vizzard MA |editors=Robertson D, Biaggioni I, ''et al.'' |publisher=Academic Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-12-386525-0 |pages=17–20}}</ref>  These sympathetic ganglia are connected to numerous organs, including the eyes, salivary glands, heart, lungs, liver, gallbladder, stomach, intestines, kidneys, urinary bladder, reproductive organs, muscles, skin, and adrenal glands.<ref name=Hamill/>  Sympathetic activation of the adrenal glands causes the part called the [[adrenal medulla]] to release norepinephrine (as well as epinephrine) into the bloodstream, from which, functioning as a [[hormone]], it gains further access to a wide variety of tissues.<ref name=Hamill/>

Broadly speaking, the effect of norepinephrine on each target organ is to modify its state in a way that makes it more conducive to active body movement, often at a cost of increased energy use and increased wear and tear.<ref name=Schacter>{{cite book|title=Psychology: European Edition |authors=Schacter D, Gilbert D, Wegner D, Hood B |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-230-34367-2 |page=93}}</ref>  This can be contrasted with the [[acetylcholine]]-mediated effects of the [[parasympathetic nervous system]], which modifies most of the same organs into a state more conducive to rest, recovery, and digestion of food, and usually less costly in terms of energy expenditure.<ref name=Schacter/>

The sympathetic effects of norepinephrine include:

* Multiple effects on the [[immune system]].  The sympathetic nervous system is the primary path of interaction between the immune system and the brain, and several components receive sympathetic inputs, including the [[thymus]], [[spleen]], and [[lymph node]]s.

=== Central nervous system ===

[[File:Noradrenergic neurons.png|thumb|Brain areas containing noradrenergic neurons.]]
The noradrenergic neurons in the brain form a [[neurotransmitter system]], that, when activated, exerts effects on large areas of the brain. The effects are manifested in alertness, [[arousal]], and readiness for action.

[[Noradrenergic]] neurons (i.e., neurons whose primary neurotransmitter is norepinephrine) are comparatively few in number, and their cell bodies are confined to a few relatively small brain areas, but they send projections to many other brain areas and exert powerful effects on their targets.  These [[noradrenergic cell groups]] were first mapped in 1964 by Annica Dahlström and Kjell Fuxe, who assigned them labels starting with the letter "A" (for "aminergic").<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dahlstroem A, Fuxe K | title = Evidence for the existence of monoamine-containing neurons in the central nervous system.

Supplementum | volume = 232 | issue = Supplement 232 | pages = 1–55 | year = 1964 | pmid = 14229500 }}</ref>  In their scheme, areas A1 through A7 contain the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (A8 through A14 contain [[dopamine]]).  [[Noradrenergic cell group A1]] is located in the caudal ventrolateral part of the medulla, and plays a role in the control of body fluid metabolism.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Antunes-Rodrigues J, de Castro M, Elias LL, Valença MM, McCann SM | title = Neuroendocrine control of body fluid metabolism | journal = Physiological Reviews | volume = 84 | issue = 1 | pages = 169–208 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14715914 | doi = 10.1152/physrev.00017.2003 | url = http://physrev.physiology.org/content/84/1/169.long }}</ref> [[Noradrenergic cell group A2]] is located in a brainstem area called the [[solitary nucleus]]; these cells have been implicated in a variety of responses, including control of food intake and responses to stress.<ref name=Rinaman>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rinaman L | title = Hindbrain noradrenergic A2 neurons: diverse roles in autonomic, endocrine, cognitive, and behavioral functions | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

The most important source of norepinephrine in the brain is the [[locus coeruleus]], which contains [[noradrenergic cell group A6]] and adjoins cell group [[Noradrenergic cell group A4|A4]].  The locus coeruleus is quite small in absolute terms—in primates it is estimated to contain around 15,000 neurons, less than one millionth of the neurons in the brain—but it sends projections to every major part of the brain and also to the spinal cord.<ref name=SaraNeuron>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sara SJ, Bouret S |title=Orienting and reorienting: the locus coeruleus mediates cognition through arousal |journal=Neuron |volume=76 |issue=1 |pages=130–41 |year=2012 |pmid=23040811 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2012.09.011 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627312008197}}</ref>

The level of activity in the locus coeruleus correlates broadly with vigilance and speed of reaction.  LC activity is low during sleep and drops to virtually nothing during the REM (dreaming) state.<ref name=Berridge>{{cite journal |vauthors=Berridge CW, Schmeichel BE, España RA |title=Noradrenergic modulation of wakefulness/arousal |journal=Sleep Med Rev |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=187–97 |year=2012 |pmid=22296742 |pmc=3278579 |doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2011.12.003 |url=}}</ref>  It runs at a baseline level during wakefulness, but increases temporarily when a person is presented with any sort of stimulus that draws attention.  Unpleasant stimuli such as pain, difficulty breathing, bladder distension, heat or cold generate larger increases.  Extremely unpleasant states such as intense fear or intense pain are associated with very high levels of LC activity.<ref name=SaraNeuron/>

Norepinephrine released by the locus coeruleus affects brain function in a number of ways.  It enhances processing of sensory inputs, enhances attention, enhances formation and retrieval of both long term and working memory, and enhances the ability of the brain to respond to inputs by changing the activity pattern in the prefrontal cortex and other areas.<ref name=Sara>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sara SJ |title=Locus Coeruleus in time with the making of memories |journal=Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. |volume=35 |issue= |pages=87–94 |year=2015 |pmid=26241632 |doi=10.1016/j.conb.2015.07.004 |url=}}</ref>  The control of arousal level is strong enough that drug-induced suppression of the LC has a powerful sedating effect.<ref name=Berridge/>

There is great similarity between situations that activate the locus coeruleus in the brain and situations that activate the sympathetic nervous system in the periphery:  the LC essentially mobilizes the brain for action while the sympathetic system mobilizes the body.  It has been argued that this similarity arises because both are to a large degree controlled by the same brain structures, particularly a part of the brainstem called the [[nucleus gigantocellularis]].<ref name=SaraNeuron/>

==Pharmacology==
{{See also|Norepinephrine (medication)}}
A large number of important drugs exert their effects by interacting with norepinephrine systems in the brain or body.  Their uses include treatment of cardiovascular problems, shock, and a variety of psychiatric conditions. These drugs are divided into: [[sympathomimetic drug]]s which mimic or enhance at least some of the effects of norepinephrine released by the sympathetic nervous system; [[sympatholytic]] drugs, in contrast, block at least some of the effects.<ref name=Gardenhire>{{cite book |title=Rau's Respiratory Care Pharmacology |author=Gardenhire DS |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-323-27714-3 |page=88}}</ref>  Both of these are large groups with diverse uses, depending on exactly which effects are enhanced or blocked.<ref name=Gardenhire/>

[[Norepinephrine (medication)|Norepinephrine]] itself is classified as a sympathomimetic drug:  its effects when given by intravenous injection of increasing heart rate and force and constricting blood vessels make it very useful for treating medical emergencies that involve critically low blood pressure.<ref name=Gardenhire/> [[Surviving Sepsis Campaign]] recommended norepinephrine as first line agent in treating [[septic shock]] which is unresponsive to [[fluid resuscitation]], supplemented by [[vasopressin]] and [[epinephrine]]. [[Dopamine]] usage is restricted only to highly selected patients.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rhodes|first1=Andrew|last2=Evans|first2=Laura E|title=Surviving Sepsis Campaign: International Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock 2016|journal=Critical Care Medicine|date=March 2017|volume=45|issue=3|pages=486–552|doi=10.1097/CCM.0000000000002255|quote=We recommend norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).}}</ref>

===Beta blockers===
{{main article|Beta blocker}}

These are [[sympatholytic]] drugs that block the effects of [[beta adrenergic receptor]]s while having little or no effect on alpha receptors.

However, the usefulness of beta blockers is limited by a range of serious side effects, including slowing of heart rate, a drop in blood pressure, asthma, and [[reactive hypoglycemia]].<ref name=Inoue/>  The negative effects can be particularly severe in people who suffer from [[diabetes]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Alpha blockers===
{{main article|Alpha blocker}}

These are [[sympatholytic]] drugs that block the effects of adrenergic alpha receptors while having little or no effect on beta receptors.<ref name=Lilley>{{cite book |title=Pharmacology and the Nursing Process, 7th edition |authors=Lilley LL, Collins SR, Snyder JS |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |year=2014| isbn=978-0-323-29361-7 |pages=313–316}}</ref>  Drugs belonging to this group can have very different effects, however, depending on whether they primarily block alpha-1 receptors, alpha-2 receptors, or both.  Alpha-2 receptors, as described elsewhere in this article, are frequently located on norepinephrine-releasing neurons themselves and have inhibitory effects on them; consequently blockage of alpha-2 receptors usually results in an increase in norepinephrine release.<ref name=Lilley/>  Alpha-1 receptors are usually located on target cells and have excitatory effects on them; consequently blockage of alpha-1 receptors usually results in blocking some of the effects of norepinephrine.<ref name=Lilley/>  Drugs such as [[phentolamine]] that act on both types of receptors can produce a complex combination of both effects. In most cases when the term "alpha blocker" is used without qualification, it refers to a selective alpha-1 antagonist.

Selective [[alpha-1 blocker]]s have a variety of uses.

Some antidepressants function partly as selective [[alpha-2 blocker]]s, but the best-known drug in that class is [[yohimbine]], which is extracted from the bark of the African [[Pausinystalia yohimbe|yohimbe]] tree.<ref name=Corazza>{{cite journal |vauthors=Corazza O, Martinotti G, Santacroce R, Chillemi E, Di Giannantonio M, Schifano F, Cellek S |title=Sexual enhancement products for sale online: raising awareness of the psychoactive effects of yohimbine, maca, horny goat weed, and Ginkgo biloba |journal=Biomed Res Int |volume=2014 |issue= |pages=841798 |year=2014 |pmid=25025070 |pmc=4082836 |doi=10.1155/2014/841798 |url=}}</ref>  Yohimbine acts as a [[erectile dysfunction|male potency enhancer]], but its usefulness for that purpose is limited by serious side-effects including anxiety and insomnia.<ref name=Corazza/>  Overdoses can cause a dangerous increase in blood pressure.<ref name=Corazza/>  Yohimbine is banned in many countries, but in the United States, because it is extracted from a plant rather than chemically synthesized, it is sold [[over the counter]] as a [[nutritional supplement]].<ref name=EFSA>{{cite journal |journal=EFSA Journal |year=2013 |volume=11 |issue=7 |page=3302 |title=Scientific Opinion on the evaluation of the safety in use of Yohimbe |url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/scientific_output/files/main_documents/3302.pdf |authors=EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources Added to Food|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2013.3302}}</ref>

===Alpha-2 agonists===

These are [[sympathomimetic]] drugs that activate [[alpha-2 receptor]]s or enhance their effects.  Because alpha-2 receptors are inhibitory and many are located presynaptically on norepinephrine-releasing cells, the net effect of these drugs is usually to reduce the amount of norepinephrine released.<ref name=Lemke>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lemke KA |title=Perioperative use of selective alpha-2 agonists and antagonists in small animals |journal=Can.

===Stimulants and antidepressants===
{{See also|Stimulant#Mechanisms of action|Antidepressant#Pharmacology}}
These are drugs whose primary effects are thought to be mediated by different neurotransmitter systems ([[dopamine]] for [[stimulant]]s, [[serotonin]] for [[antidepressant]]s), but many also increase levels of norepinephrine in the brain.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} [[Amphetamine]], for example, is a stimulant that increases release of norepinephrine as well as dopamine.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Heal |first1=David J. |last2=Smith |first2=Sharon L. |last3=Gosden |first3=Jane |last4=Nutt |first4=David J. |date=June 2013 |title=Amphetamine, past and present—a pharmacological and clinical perspective |journal=Journal of Psychopharmacology |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=479–496 |doi=10.1177/0269881113482532 |pmc=3666194 |pmid=23539642 }}</ref> [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s are antidepressants that inhibit the metabolic degradation of norepinephrine as well as serotonin.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In some cases it is difficult to distinguish the norepinephrine-mediated effects from the effects related to other neurotransmitters.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Diseases and disorders==

A number of important medical problems involve dysfunction of the norepinephrine system in the brain or body.

===Sympathetic hyperactivation===

Hyperactivation of the [[sympathetic nervous system]] is not a recognized condition in itself, but it is a component of a number of conditions, as well as a possible consequence of taking [[sympathomimetic drug]]s.  It causes a distinctive set of symptoms including aches and pains, rapid heartbeat, elevated blood pressure, sweating, palpitations, anxiety, headache, paleness, and a drop in blood glucose.  If sympathetic activity is elevated for an extended time, it can cause weight loss and other stress-related body changes.

The list of conditions that can cause sympathetic hyperactivation includes severe brain injury,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lump D, Moyer M |title=Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity after severe brain injury |journal=Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep |volume=14 |issue=11 |pages=494 |year=2014 |pmid=25220846 |doi=10.1007/s11910-014-0494-0 |url=}}</ref> spinal cord damage,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Amzallag M |title=Autonomic hyperreflexia |journal=Int Anesthesiol Clin |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=87–102 |year=1993 |pmid=8440534 |doi= 10.1097/00004311-199331010-00009|url=}}</ref> heart failure,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=McCrink KA, Brill A, Lymperopoulos A |title=Adrenal G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 in regulation of sympathetic nervous system activity in heart failure |journal=World J Cardiol |volume=7 |issue=9 |pages=539–43 |year=2015 |pmid=26413230 |doi=10.4330/wjc.v7.i9.539 |pmc=4577680}}</ref> high blood pressure,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Malpas SC |title=Sympathetic nervous system overactivity and its role in the development of cardiovascular disease |journal=Physiol.

===Pheochromocytoma===

A [[pheochromocytoma]] is a rarely occurring tumor of the [[adrenal medulla]], caused either by genetic factors or certain types of cancer.  The consequence is a massive increase in the amount of norepinephrine and epinephrine released into the bloodstream.  The most obvious symptoms are those of sympathetic hyperactivation, including particularly a rise in blood pressure that can reach fatal levels.  The most effective treatment is surgical removal of the tumor.

===Stress===

[[Stress (biology)|Stress]], to a physiologist, means any situation that threatens the continued stability of the body and its functions.<ref name=Chrousos>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chrousos GP |title=Stress and disorders of the stress system |journal=Nat Rev Endocrinol |volume=5 |issue=7 |pages=374–81 |year=2009 |pmid=19488073 |doi=10.1038/nrendo.2009.106 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/George_Chrousos/publication/26258826_Stress_and_disorders_of_the_stress_system/links/09e4150f0899bf1a02000000.pdf}}</ref> Stress affects a wide variety of body systems:  the two most consistently activated are the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] and the norepinephrine system, including both the [[sympathetic nervous system]] and the [[locus coeruleus]]-centered system in the brain.<ref name=Chrousos/>  Stressors of many types evoke increases in noradrenergic activity, which mobilizes the brain and body to meet the threat.<ref name=Chrousos/>  Chronic stress, if continued for a long time, can damage many parts of the body.  A significant part of the damage is due to the effects of sustained norepinephrine release, because of norepinephrine's general function of directing resources away from maintenance, regeneration, and reproduction, and toward systems that are required for active movement.  The consequences can include slowing of growth (in children), sleeplessness, loss of libido, gastrointestinal problems, impaired disease resistance, slower rates of injury healing, depression, and increased vulnerability to addiction.<ref name=Chrousos/>

===ADHD===

[[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] is a psychiatric condition involving problems with attention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness.<ref name=Kooij>{{cite journal |authors= Kooij SJ, Bejerot S | title = European consensus statement on diagnosis and treatment of adult ADHD: The European Network Adult ADHD | journal = BMC Psychiatry | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 67 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20815868 | pmc = 2942810 | doi = 10.1186/1471-244X-10-67 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> It is most commonly treated using [[stimulant]] drugs such as [[methylphenidate]] (Ritalin), whose primary effect is to increase [[dopamine]] levels in the brain, but drugs in this group also generally increase brain levels of norepinephrine, and it has been difficult to determine whether these actions are involved in their clinical value.  Also there is substantial evidence that many people with ADHD show "biomarkers" involving altered norepinephrine processing.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Faraone SV, Bonvicini C, Scassellati C |title=Biomarkers in the diagnosis of ADHD--promising directions |journal=Curr Psychiatry Rep |volume=16 |issue=11 |pages=497 |year=2014 |pmid=25298126 |doi=10.1007/s11920-014-0497-1 |url=}}</ref> Several drugs whose primary effects are on norepinephrine, including [[guanfacine]], [[clonidine]], and [[atomoxetine]], have been tried as treatments for ADHD, and found to have effects comparable to those of stimulants.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bello NT |title=Clinical utility of guanfacine extended release in the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents |journal=Patient Prefer Adherence |volume=9 |issue= |pages=877–85 |year=2015 |pmid=26170637 |pmc=4494608 |doi=10.2147/PPA.S73167 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Clemow DB, Bushe CJ |title=Atomoxetine in patients with ADHD: A clinical and pharmacological review of the onset, trajectory, duration of response and implications for patients |journal=J.

===Autonomic failure===

Several conditions, including [[Parkinson's disease]], [[diabetes]] and so-called [[pure autonomic failure]], can cause a loss of norepinephrine-secreting neurons in the sympathetic nervous system.  The symptoms are widespread, the most serious being a reduction in heart rate and an extreme drop in resting blood pressure, making it impossible for severely affected people to stand for more than a few seconds without fainting.  Treatment can involve dietary changes or drugs.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Shibao C, Okamoto L, Biaggioni I |title=Pharmacotherapy of autonomic failure |journal=Pharmacol.

==History==
{{main article|History of catecholamine research}}

Early in the twentieth century [[Walter Bradford Cannon|Walter Cannon]], who had popularized the idea of a [[sympathoadrenal system]] preparing the body for [[Fight-or-flight response|fight and flight]], and his colleague [[Arturo Rosenblueth]] developed a theory of two ''sympathins'', ''sympathin E'' (excitatory) and ''sympathin I'' (inhibitory), responsible for these actions.<ref name=Bacq/> The Belgian pharmacologist [[Zénon Bacq]] as well as Canadian and US-American pharmacologists between 1934 and 1938 suggested that noradrenaline might be a sympathetic transmitter.<ref name=Bacq>{{cite book |author=Bacq ZM |chapter=Chemical transmission of nerve impulses |editors=Parnham MJ, Bruinvels J |title=Discoveries in Pharmacology, Volume 1 |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Elsevier |year=1983 |pages=49–103 |isbn=0-444-80493-5}}</ref> In 1939, Hermann Blaschko and Peter Holtz independently identified the biosynthetic mechanism for norepinephrine in the vertebrate body.<ref name="Blaschko1987">{{cite journal | author = Herman Blaschko|year = 1987|title = A half-century of research on catecholamine biosynthesis|journal=Journal of Applied Cardiology|volume = |pages = 171–183}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author =P.

==Medical uses==

== Side effects ==
The most serious complication of bleomycin is [[pulmonary fibrosis]] and impaired lung function.

Other [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] include [[fever]], rash, [[dermatographism]], [[hyperpigmentation]], [[alopecia]] (hair loss) and [[Raynaud's phenomenon]] (discoloration of fingers and toes).

== Mechanism of action ==
Bleomycin acts by induction of [[DNA]] strand breaks.<ref>Takimoto CH, Calvo E. [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter03/article/10165/1402628 "Principles of Oncologic Pharmacotherapy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515221337/http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter03/article/10165/1402628 |date=2009-05-15 }} in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004224102/http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ |date=2013-10-04 }}. 11 ed. 2008.</ref> Some studies suggest bleomycin also inhibits incorporation of [[thymidine]] into DNA strands. DNA cleavage by bleomycin depends on oxygen and metal ions, at least ''in vitro''. The exact mechanism of DNA strand scission is unresolved, but it has been suggested that bleomycin [[chelation|chelates]] metal ions (primarily iron), producing a pseudoenzyme that reacts with oxygen to produce superoxide and hydroxide [[free radicals]] that cleave DNA. An alternative hypothesis states that bleomycin may bind at specific sites in the DNA strand and induce scission by abstracting the hydrogen atom from the base, resulting in strand cleavage as the base undergoes a [[Criegee rearrangement|Criegee-type rearrangement]], or forms an alkali-labile lesion.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 10650103 | year = 2000 | last1 = Hecht | first1 = SM|title=Bleomycin: new perspectives on the mechanism of action |volume=63|pages=158–168|journal=J. Nat. Prod. | doi=10.1021/np990549f}}</ref> In addition, these complexes also mediate [[lipid peroxidation]] and oxidation of other cellular molecules. Therefore, bleomycin is used in combination with [[doxorubicin]] in Hodgkins lymphoma, as they have additive and complementary effects on the DNA, since doxorubicin acts by [[Intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalating]] between DNA  strands, and also acts on [[topoisomerase|topoisomerase II]] enzyme thus relaxing the topoisomerase complexes.

== Biosynthesis ==
Bleomycin is a [[nonribosomal peptide]] that is a hybrid [[peptide]]-[[polyketide]] [[natural product]].  The [[peptide]]/[[polyketide]]/[[peptide]] backbone of the bleomycin [[aglycon]] is assembled by the bleomycin megasynthetase, which is made of both nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) modules. Nonribosomal peptides and polyketides are synthesized from amino acids and short carboxylic acids by NRPSs and PKSs, respectively. These NRPSs and PKSs use similar strategies for the assembly of these two distinct classes of natural products. Both NRPs and type I PKSs are organized into modules. The structural variations of the resulting peptide and polyketide products are determined by the number and order of modules on each NRPS and PKS protein.

The biosynthesis of the bleomycin aglycon can be visualized in three stages:

#NRPS-mediated formation of P-3A from Ser, Asn, His, and Ala
#PKS-mediated elongation of P-3A by malonyl CoA and AdoMet to yield P-4
#NRPS-mediated elongation of P-4 by Thr to P-5 that is further elongated by β-Ala, Cys, and Cys to get P-6m.

On the basis of the bleomycin structure and the deduced functions of individual NRPS and PKS domains and modules, a linear model for the bleomycin megasynthetase-templated assembly of the bleomycin peptide/polyketide/peptide aglycon was proposed from nine amino acids and one acetate.

== History ==
{{see also|History of cancer chemotherapy}}
Bleomycin was first discovered in 1966 when the Japanese scientist [[Hamao Umezawa]] found anticancer activity while screening culture filtrates of ''[[Streptomyces verticillus]]''. Umezawa published his discovery in 1966.<ref>Umenzawa, H. et al. ''J. Antibiot.'' (Tokyo) Ser. A 1966, 19, 200.</ref> The drug was launched in Japan by [[Nippon Kayaku]] in 1969. In the US, bleomycin gained [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval in July 1973. It was initially marketed in the US by the [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] precursor, Bristol Laboratories, under the brand name Blenoxane.

==Research==
Bleomycin is used in research to induce [[pulmonary fibrosis]] in mice.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Vagotomy attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep13419|quote=In our studies, mice developed classic PF with structural alteration of the lung following intravenous bleomycin treatment|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503222228/http://www.nature.com/articles/srep13419|archivedate=2016-05-03|df=}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
When used to treat [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]], it is often delivered as part of the [[BEACOPP]] regimen that includes [[bleomycin]], [[etoposide]], [[adriamycin]], [[cyclophosphamide]], [[vincristine]] (tradename Oncovin), [[prednisone]], and procarbazine. The first combination chemotherapy developed for Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), [[MOPP]] also included procarbazine ([[ABVD]] has supplanted MOPP as standard first line treatment for HL, with BEACOPP as an alternative for advanced/unfavorable HL). Alternatively, when used to treat certain brain tumors (malignant gliomas), it is often dosed as PCV when combined with [[lomustine]] (often called CCNU) and vincristine.

Dose should be adjusted for kidney disease or liver disease.

==Side effects==

==Medical uses==
Vincristine is delivered via [[intravenous]] [[route of administration|infusion]] for use in various types of [[chemotherapy regimens]].<ref name = MD/> Its main uses are in non-Hodgkin's [[lymphoma]] as part of the chemotherapy regimen [[CHOP]], [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]] as part of MOPP, COPP, BEACOPP, or the less popular [[Stanford V]] chemotherapy regimen in [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] (ALL), and in treatment for [[nephroblastoma]].<ref name = MD/> It is also used to induce remission in ALL with [[dexamethasone]] and L-[[Asparaginase]], and in combination with [[prednisone]] to treat childhood leukemia.<ref name = MD/>  Vincristine is occasionally used as an [[immunosuppressant]], for example,  in treating [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]] (TTP) or chronic [[idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]] (ITP).<ref name = MD/>

==Side effects==
The main side effects of vincristine are [[chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy]], [[hyponatremia]], [[constipation]], and [[alopecia|hair loss]].

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy can be severe, and may be a reason to reduce or avoid using vincristine. The symptoms of this are progressive and enduring tingling numbness, pain and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes affecting the arms and legs.<ref name=NCI>{{vcite journal | author = del Pino BM | date = Feb 23, 2010 | journal = NCI Cancer Bulletin | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | page = 6 | title = Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy | url = http://www.cancer.gov/aboutnci/ncicancerbulletin/archive/2010/022310/page6 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111211105234/http://www.cancer.gov/aboutnci/ncicancerbulletin/archive/2010/022310/page6 | archivedate = 2011-12-11 | df =  }}</ref> One of the first symptoms of peripheral neuropathy is [[foot drop]]: A person with a family history of foot drop and/or [[Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease]] (CMT) should avoid the taking of vincristine.<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Graf, W.

Accidental injection of vinca alkaloids into the spinal canal ([[intrathecal]] administration) is highly dangerous, with a mortality rate approaching 100 percent.  The medical literature documents cases of ascending [[paralysis]] due to massive [[encephalopathy]] and spinal nerve [[demyelination]], accompanied by intractable pain, almost uniformly leading to death.  Several patients have survived after aggressive and immediate intervention.   Rescue treatments consist of washout of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] and administration of protective medications.<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Qweider, M. |author2=Gilsbach, J.

A significant series of inadvertent intrathecal vincristine administration occurred in [[China]] in 2007 when batches of [[cytarabine]] and [[methotrexate]] (both often used intrathecally) manufactured by the company Shanghai Hualian were found to be contaminated with vincristine.<ref>{{ cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/31/world/asia/31pharma.html?_r=1&ref=health | title = Tainted Drugs Tied to Maker of Abortion Pill | author = [[Jake Hooker (journalist)|Jake Hooker]] and [[Walt Bogdanich]] | newspaper = New York Times | date = January 31, 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170326140321/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/31/world/asia/31pharma.html?_r=1&ref=health | archivedate = March 26, 2017 | df =  }}</ref>

The overuse of vincristine may also lead to [[drug resistance]] by overexpression of the [[p-glycoprotein]] pump (Pgp). There is an attempt to overcome resistance by the addition of derivatives and substituents to the vincristine molecule.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sears, J.; Boger, D.|title=Total Synthesis of Vinblastine, Related Natural Products, and Key Analogues and Development of Inspired Methodology Suitable for the Systematic Study of Their Structure-Function Properties|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|date=2015|volume=48|pages=653–662|doi=10.1021/ar500400w}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Vincristine works partly by binding to the [[tubulin]] protein, stopping the cell from separating its [[chromosome]]s during the [[metaphase]]; the cell then undergoes [[apoptosis]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jordan|first1=MA|title=Mechanism of action of antitumor drugs that interact with microtubules and tubulin.|journal=Current medicinal chemistry. Anti-cancer agents|date=January 2002|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1–17|pmid=12678749|doi=10.2174/1568011023354290}}</ref> 
The vincristine molecule inhibits [[leukocyte]] production and maturation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Silverman, J.; Deitcher, S.|title=Marqibo (R) (vincristine sulfate liposome injection) improves the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of vincristine|journal=Cancer Chemotherapy and Pharmacology|date=2013|volume=71|pages=555–564|doi=10.1007/s00280-012-2042-4}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
Vincristine is created through the semi-synthesis coupling of indole alkaloids [[vindoline]] and [[catharanthine]] in the vinca plant.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2012/01/pharmacognosy-of-vinca-alkaloids-periwinkle/ | title = Pharmacognosy of Vinca Alkaloids | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120106234053/http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2012/01/pharmacognosy-of-vinca-alkaloids-periwinkle/ | archivedate = 2012-01-06 | df =  }}</ref> It can also now be synthesized through a stereocontrolled total synthesis technique which retains the correct stereochemistry at C18' and C2'. The absolute stereochemistry at these carbons is responsible for vincristine's anticancer activity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kuboyama, T.; Yokoshima, S.; Tokuyama, H.; Fukuyama, T.|title=Stereocontrolled total synthesis of (+)-vincristine|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=2004|volume=101|pages=11966–11970|doi=10.1073/pnas.0401323101}}</ref>

The [[liposome]] encapsulation of vincristine enhances the efficacy of the vincristine drug while simultaneously decreasing the [[neurotoxicity]] associated with it. Liposome encapsulation increases vincristine's plasma concentration and circulation lifetime in the body, and allows the drug to enter cells more easily.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Waterhouse, D.; Madden, T.; Cullis, P.; Bally, M.; Mayer, L.; Webb, M.|title=Preparation, Characterization, and Biological Analysis of Liposomal Formulations of Vincristine|journal=Methods in Enzymology|date=2005|volume=391|pages=40–57|doi=10.1016/s0076-6879(05)91002-1}}</ref>

==History==
Having been used as a folk remedy for centuries, studies in the 1950s revealed that the rosy periwinkle ''[[Catharanthus roseus]]'' contained 70 alkaloids, many of which are biologically active. While initial studies for its use in [[diabetes mellitus]] were disappointing, the discovery that it caused [[myelosuppression]] (decreased activity of the bone marrow) led to its study in mice with [[leukemia]], whose lifespan was prolonged by the use of a vinca preparation. Treatment of the ground plant with Skelly-B defatting agent and an acid benzene extract led to a fraction termed "fraction A".  This fraction was further treated with [[aluminium oxide]], [[chromatography]], [[Chloroform|trichloromethane]], benz-dichloromethane, and separation by pH to yield vincristine.<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Johnson, I.

P. | title = The Vinca Alkaloids: A New Class of Oncolytic Agents | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 23 | issue = 8 Part 1 | pages = 1390–1427 | year = 1963 | pmid = 14070392 | url = http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/23/8_Part_1/1390.full.pdf | format = pdf }}</ref>

Vincristine was approved by the [[United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in July 1963 as Oncovin.  The drug was initially discovered by a team led by Dr. J.G. Armstrong, then marketed by [[Eli Lilly and Company]].  Eli Lilly required lots of leaves of the periwinkle plant. They needed one ton of dried leaves to produce one ounce of vincristine. Periwinkle was grown on a ranch in Texas to produce vincristine for some time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eli Lilly engineers developed a life-saving drug from the leaves of the periwinkle plant. – Treating Diabetes|url=https://tacomed.com/chapter-12-recombinant-dna-production-of-insulin/eli-lilly-engineers-developed-a-life-saving-drug-from-the-leaves-of-the-periwinkle-plant/|website=Treating Diabetes|accessdate=18 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908170135/https://tacomed.com/chapter-12-recombinant-dna-production-of-insulin/eli-lilly-engineers-developed-a-life-saving-drug-from-the-leaves-of-the-periwinkle-plant/|archivedate=8 September 2017|df=}}</ref>

==Isolation and synthesis==
Vinblastine may be isolated from the Madagascar Periwinkle (''[[Catharanthus roseus]]''), along with several of its precursors, [[catharanthine]] and [[vindoline]].  Extraction is costly and yields of vinblastine and its precursors are low, although procedures for rapid isolation with improved yields avoiding auto-oxidation have been developed.  Enantioselective synthesis has been of considerable interest in recent years, as the natural mixture of isomers is not an economical source for the required C16’S, C14’R  stereochemistry of biologically active vinblastine.  Initially, the approach depends upon an enantioselective Sharpless epoxidation, which sets the stereochemistry at C20.  The desired configuration around C16 and C14 can then be fixed during the ensuing steps.  In this pathway, vinblastine is constructed by a series of cyclization and coupling reactions which create the required stereochemistry.  The overall yield may be as great as 22%, which makes this synthetic approach more attractive than extraction from natural sources, whose overall yield is about 10%.<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Kuehne, M.

== History ==
Vinblastine was first isolated by [[Robert Noble]] and [[Charles Thomas Beer]] at the University of [[Western Ontario]] from the [[Madagascar periwinkle]] plant. Vinblastine's utility as a chemotherapeutic agent was first suggested by its effect on the body when an extract of the plant was injected in rabbits to study the plant's supposed anti-diabetic effect. (A tea made from the plant was a folk-remedy for diabetes.) The rabbits succumbed to a bacterial infection, due to a [[leukopenia|decreased number of white blood cells]], so it was hypothesized that vinblastine might be effective against cancers of the [[white blood cell]]s such as [[lymphoma]].<ref>R.C. Noble, C.T. Beer, and J.H. Cutts (5 December 1958) "Role of chance observations in chemotherapy:  ''Vinca rosea''," ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'', '''76''' (3):  882-894.</ref>

'''Lomustine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), abbreviated '''CCNU''' (original brand name (formerly available) is '''CeeNU''', now marketed as '''Gleostine'''), is an [[alkylating antineoplastic agent|alkylating]] [[nitrosourea compounds|nitrosourea compound]] used in [[chemotherapy]]. It is closely related to [[semustine]] and is in the same family as [[streptozotocin]]. It is a highly lipid-soluble drug,<ref name = "Drug Manual">{{cite web | title = BC Cancer Agency Cancer Drug Manual.

==Price increase==

In the U.S., the patent for lomustine has expired, but only one company manufactures it. In 2013, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. sold its CeeNU brand of lomustine to CordenPharma, a subsidiary of International Chemical Investors S.E., which markets it as Gleostine through NextSource Biotechnology. In 2013, BMS charged $50 a capsule. In 2018, NextSource charged $768 a capsule. Some doctors said the price increase made it unaffordable, and one doctor called it "price gouging."<ref>[https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/cancer-drug-price-rises-1400percent-with-no-generic-to-challenge-it/ar-BBHjrTV Cancer Drug Price Rises 1400% With No Generic to Challenge It], Peter Loftus, The Wall Street Journal, 12/26/2017 [FREE]</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = NextSource Biotechnology Gains FDA Approval for Use of Tradename Gleostine (lomustine), an Anti-Cancer Chemotherapy Agent | url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nextsource-biotechnology-gains-fda-approval-for-use-of-tradename-gleostine-lomustine-an-anti-cancer-chemotherapy-agent-270367311.html | website = www.prnewswire.com | publisher = NextSource Biotechnology | accessdate = 15 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Gleostine (lomustine) Capsules — Healthcare Providers | url = http://www.nextsourcebiotechnology.com/products/gleostine.aspx | publisher = NextSource Biotechnology | accessdate = 15 July 2016}}</ref>

==Side effects==
Like many chemotherapy drugs, dacarbazine may have numerous serious side effects, because it interferes with normal cell growth as well as cancer cell growth.  Among the most serious possible side effects are birth defects to children conceived or carried during treatment; sterility, possibly permanent; or immune suppression (reduced ability to fight infection or disease). Dacarbazine is considered to be highly [[Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting|emetogenic]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Aoki|first1=S|last2=Iihara|first2=H|last3=Nishigaki|first3=M|last4=Imanishi|first4=Y|last5=Yamauchi|first5=K|last6=Ishihara|first6=M|last7=Kitaichi|first7=K|last8=Itoh|first8=Y|title=Difference in the emetic control among highly emetogenic chemotherapy regimens: Implementation for appropriate use of aprepitant.|journal=Molecular and clinical oncology|date=January 2013|volume=1|issue=1|pages=41–46|doi=10.3892/mco.2012.15|pmid=24649120|pmc=3956247}}</ref> and most patients will be pre-medicated with [[dexamethasone]] and antiemetic drugs like [[5-HT3 antagonist|5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist]] (e.g., [[ondansetron]]) and/or [[NK1 receptor antagonist|NK<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist]] (e.g., [[aprepitant]]). Other significant side effects include headache, fatigue and occasionally diarrhea.

The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare has sent out a [[Boxed warning|black box warning]] and suggests avoiding dacarbazine due to liver problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fass.se/LIF/produktfakta/audit_page.jsp?_sourcePage%3D%2Fproduktfakta%2Fartikel_produkt.jsp%26docType%3D7%26nplId%3D19971212000080 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001011425/http://www.fass.se/LIF/produktfakta/audit_page.jsp?_sourcePage=%2Fproduktfakta%2Fartikel_produkt.jsp&docType=7&nplId=19971212000080 |archivedate=October 1, 2011 }}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Dacarbazine works by methylating guanine at the O-6 and N-7 positions.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kewitz|first1=S|last2=Stiefel|first2=M|last3=Kramm|first3=CM|last4=Staege|first4=MS|title=Impact of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation and MGMT expression on dacarbazine resistance of Hodgkin's lymphoma cells.|journal=Leukemia research|date=January 2014|volume=38|issue=1|pages=138–43|pmid=24284332|doi=10.1016/j.leukres.2013.11.001}}</ref> Guanine is one of the four nucleotides that makes up DNA. The methylated DNA strands stick together such that cell division becomes impossible. This affects cancer cells more than healthy cells because cancer cells divide faster. Unfortunately however, some of the healthy cells will still be damaged.

Dacarbazine is bioactivated in liver by demethylation to "MTIC" and then to [[diazomethane]], which is an alkylating agent.

==Synthesis==
[[File:Dacarbazine-synthesis.svg|thumb|512px|center|Shealy et al., J. Org. Chem. 27, 2150 (1962); Hano et al., Gann 59, 207 (1968), C.A. 69, 42527g (1968).]]

==History==
{{see also|History of cancer chemotherapy}}
Dacarbazine was developed by Y. Fulmer Shealy, PhD at Southern Research Institute in Birmingham, Alabama. Research was funded by a U.S. federal grant. Dacarbazine gained FDA approval in May 1975 as DTIC-Dome. The drug was initially marketed by [[Bayer]].

==Suppliers==
[[Bayer]] continues to supply DTIC-Dome. There are also [[Generic drug|generic]] versions of dacarbazine available from APP, Bedford, Mayne Pharma (now [[Hospira]]) and [[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries|Teva]].

===Liposomal form===<!--Liposomal doxorubicin, Doxil, Caelyx, Myocet redirect here!-->
There is a [[pegylated]] (polyethylene glycol coated) [[liposome]]-encapsulated form of doxorubicin, sold as Doxil. It was developed to treat [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], an [[AIDS]]-related cancer that causes lesions to grow under the skin, in the lining of the mouth, nose and throat, or in other organs. The [[polyethylene glycol]] coating results in preferential concentration of doxorubicin in the skin. However, this also results in a side effect called [[palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia]] (PPE), more commonly known as hand-foot syndrome.  Following administration of this form of doxorubicin, small amounts of the drug can leak from capillaries in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.  The result of this leakage is redness, tenderness, and peeling of the skin that can be uncomfortable and even painful.  In clinical testing at 50&nbsp;mg/m<sup>2</sup> dosing every 4 weeks, half of people developed hand-foot syndrome. The rate of this side effect limits the dose of this formulation that can be given as compared with plain doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby limiting potential substitution. Substitution would be desirable because liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin is less cardiotoxic than unencapsulated doxorubicin.  This form is also approved by the FDA for treatment of ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma.<ref name=Macmillan>{{cite web |url=http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Cancertreatment/Treatmenttypes/Chemotherapy/Individualdrugs/Liposomaldoxorubicin.aspx |title=Liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx, Myocet) |publisher=Macmillan Cancer Support |date=April 1, 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091129030936/http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Cancertreatment/Treatmenttypes/Chemotherapy/Individualdrugs/Liposomaldoxorubicin.aspx |archivedate=November 29, 2009 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chemocare.com/bio/doxorubicin_liposomal.asp |title=Doxorubicin liposomal |publisher=[[Cleveland Clinic]] |work=Chemocare |accessdate=2009-11-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102095755/http://chemocare.com/bio/doxorubicin_liposomal.asp |archivedate=2010-01-02 |df= }}</ref>

A non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, called Myocet, is approved in Europe and Canada for treatment of metastatic breast cancer in combination with [[cyclophosphamide]], but has not been approved by the FDA for use in the United States. Unlike Doxil, the Myocet liposome does not have a polyethylene glycol coating, and therefore does not result in the same rate of hand-foot syndrome. The minimization of this side effect may allow for one-for-one (1:1) substitution with doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby improving safety with no loss of efficacy. Like Doxil, the liposomal encapsulation of the doxorubicin limits the cardiotoxicity. In theory, by limiting the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin through liposomal encapsulation, it can be used safely in concurrent combination with other cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs, such as trastuzumab. There is an FDA black box warning that trastuzumab cannot be used in concurrent combination with doxorubicin, only in sequential combination. Though concurrent combination of trastuzumab and doxorubicin in clinical studies found superior tumor response, the combination resulted in unacceptable cardiotoxicity, including risk of cardiac failure manifesting as [[congestive heart failure]] (CHF). Published phase II study results have shown that Myocet, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel can safely be used concurrently without the cardiac risk, as measured by reduction in [[LVEF]] function, while still achieving superior tumor response. This finding is the basis for the ongoing phase III trial for FDA approval.<ref name=Macmillan/>

== Side effects ==
The most dangerous side effect of doxorubicin is [[dilated cardiomyopathy]], leading to [[congestive heart failure]]. The rate of cardiomyopathy is dependent on its cumulative dose, with an incidence about 4% when the dose of doxorubicin is 500–550&nbsp;mg/m², 18% when the dose is 551–600&nbsp;mg/m² and 36% when the dose exceeds 600&nbsp;mg/m².<ref name="Chaterjee">{{cite journal|last=Chaterjee|first=Kanu|author2=Jianqing Zhang |author3=Norman Honbo |author4=Joel S.

== Biosynthesis ==
{{main|Biosynthesis of doxorubicin}}
Doxorubicin (DXR) is a 14-[[hydroxylated]] version of [[daunorubicin]], the immediate precursor of DXR in its [[Biosynthesis|biosynthetic]] pathway. [[Daunorubicin]] is more abundantly found as a [[natural product]] because it is produced by a number of different [[wild type]] [[Strain (biology)|strains]] of ''[[Streptomyces]]''. In contrast, only one known non-[[wild type]] [[species]], ''[[Streptomyces peucetius]]'' [[subspecies]] ''cesius'' ATCC 27952, was initially found to be capable of producing the more widely used doxorubicin.<ref name="pmid9864344">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lomovskaya N, Otten SL, Doi-Katayama Y, etal |title=Doxorubicin overproduction in ''Streptomyces peucetius'': cloning and characterization of the dnrU ketoreductase and dnrV genes and the doxA cytochrome P-450 hydroxylase gene |journal=J.

== History ==
{{see also|Anthracycline#History|Daunorubicin#History|History of cancer chemotherapy}}
In the 1950s, an Italian research company, [[Farmitalia]] Research Laboratories, began an organized effort to find anticancer compounds from soil-based microbes. A soil sample was isolated from the area surrounding the [[Castel del Monte, Apulia|Castel del Monte]], a 13th-century castle. A new strain of ''[[Streptomyces peucetius]]'', which produced a red pigment, was isolated, and an antibiotic from this bacterium was effective against tumors in mice. Since a group of French researchers discovered the same compound at about the same time, the two teams named the compound [[daunorubicin]], combining the name ''[[Dauni]]'', a pre-Roman tribe that occupied the area of Italy where the compound was isolated, with the French word for [[ruby]], ''rubis'', describing the color.<ref name="weiss">{{cite journal |author=Weiss RB |title=The anthracyclines: will we ever find a better doxorubicin? |journal=Seminars in Oncology |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=670–86 |date=December 1992 |pmid=1462166}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 5332105 | volume=60 | issue=2 | title=Clinical trials in Plasmodium falciparum malaria with a long-acting sulphonamide | year=1966 | journal=Trans.

Researchers at Farmitalia soon discovered that changes in biological activity could be made by minor changes in the structure of the compound. A strain of ''Streptomyces'' was mutated using ''N''-nitroso-''N''-methyl urethane, and this new strain produced a different, red-colored antibiotic. They named this new compound Adriamycin, after the [[Adriatic Sea]], and the name was later changed to doxorubicin to conform to the established naming convention.<ref name="pmid5365804"/> Doxorubicin showed better activity than daunorubicin against mouse tumors, and especially solid tumors.

Doxorubicin and daunorubicin together can be thought of as prototype compounds for the [[anthracycline]]s. Subsequent research has led to many other anthracycline antibiotics, or analogs, and there are now over 2,000 known analogs of doxorubicin.

However, there are significant limitations, as doxorubicin's fluorescence spectrum is known to depend on a variety of factors, including the pH of the environment, solvent [[dielectric constant]] and others. Doxorubicin fluorescence is quenched by binding to DNA, and shielded by micelle encapsulation. It is also known to self-quench at high concentrations. In contrast, histone binding amplifies fluorescence.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Karukstis K, Thompson E, Whiles J, Rosenfeld R | year = 1998 | title = Deciphering the fluorescence signature of daunomycin and doxorubicin | url = | journal = Biophysical Chemistry | volume = 73 | issue = 3| pages = 249–263 | doi=10.1016/s0301-4622(98)00150-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Mohan P, Rapoport N | year = 2010 | title = Doxorubicin as a Molecular Nanotheranostic Agent: Effect of Doxorubicin Encapsulation in Micelles or Nanoemulsions on the Ultrasound-Mediated Intracellular Delivery and Nuclear Trafficking | url = | journal = Mol.

'''Prednisone''' is a synthetic [[Glucocorticoid|corticosteroid]] drug that is particularly effective as an [[immunosuppressive drug|immunosuppressant drug]]. It is used to treat certain [[inflammation|inflammatory]] diseases (such as moderate [[allergy|allergic]] reactions), some [[autoimmune disease]]s, and (at higher doses) some types of [[cancer]], but it has significant [[adverse effect]]s.

== Medical uses ==
Prednisone is used for many different [[autoimmune disease]]s and inflammatory conditions, including: [[asthma]], [[COPD]], [[CIDP]], [[rheumatic disorders]], [[allergic]] disorders, [[ulcerative colitis]] and [[Crohn's disease]], [[adrenocortical insufficiency]], [[hypercalcemia]] due to cancer, [[thyroiditis]], [[laryngitis]], severe [[tuberculosis]], [[urticaria]] (hives), [[lipid pneumonitis]], [[pericarditis]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[nephrotic syndrome]], [[sarcoidosis]], to relieve the effects of [[shingles]], [[lupus]], [[myasthenia gravis]], [[poison oak]] exposure, [[Ménière's disease]],  [[autoimmune hepatitis]], the [[Herxheimer reaction]] that is common during the treatment of [[syphilis]], [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]], [[uveitis]], and as part of a drug regimen to prevent rejection after [[organ transplant]].<ref>{{EMedicine|article|172356|Autoimmune Hepatitis|treatment}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://livertox.nlm.nih.gov//Corticosteroids.htm|title=Corticosteroids|website=livertox.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2017-04-07}}</ref><ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=Prednisone|url=https://www.drugs.com/monograph/prednisone.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref>

Prednisone has also been used in the treatment of [[migraine]] headaches and [[cluster headache]]s and for severe [[aphthous ulcer]]. Prednisone is used as an [[antitumor drug]].<ref>[U.S.] National Library of Medicine, Medical Subject Headings.

== Side effects ==
Short-term side effects, as with all glucocorticoids, include high blood [[glucose]] levels (especially in patients with [[diabetes mellitus]] or on other medications that increase blood glucose, such as [[tacrolimus]]) and [[mineralocorticoid]] effects such as fluid retention.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/steroids/art-20045692?pg=2|title=Prednisone and other corticosteroids: Balance the risks and benefits - Mayo Clinic|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en}}</ref> The mineralocorticoid effects of prednisone are minor, which is why it is not used in the management of adrenal insufficiency, unless a more potent mineralocorticoid is administered concomitantly.

=== Dependency ===
[[Adrenal gland|Adrenal]] suppression will begin to occur if prednisone is taken for longer than seven days.  Eventually, this may cause the body to temporarily lose the ability to manufacture natural corticosteroids (especially cortisol), which results in dependence on prednisone. For this reason, prednisone should not be abruptly stopped if taken for more than seven days; instead, the dosage should be gradually reduced. This weaning process may be over a few days if the course of prednisone was short, but may take weeks or months {{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} if the patient had been on long-term treatment. Abrupt withdrawal may lead to an [[Addison's disease#Addisonian crisis|Addison crisis]]. For those on chronic therapy, alternate-day dosing may preserve adrenal function and thereby reduce side effects.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080711145809/http://www.uspharmacist.com/NewLook/CE/glucocort/lesson.htm |title=Therapeutic and Adverse Effects of Glucocorticoids |work=Bello CS, Garrett SD. U.S. Pharmacist Continuing Education Program no. 430-000-99-028-H01, August 1999}}</ref>

Glucocorticoids act to inhibit feedback of both the [[hypothalamus]], decreasing [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] [CRH], and [[corticotrophs]] in the [[anterior pituitary]] gland, decreasing the amount of [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] [ACTH]. For this reason, glucocorticoid analogue drugs such as prednisone down-regulate the natural synthesis of glucocorticoids.  This mechanism leads to dependence in a short time and can be dangerous if medications are withdrawn too quickly. The body must have time to begin synthesis of CRH and ACTH and for the adrenal glands to begin functioning normally again.

=== Withdrawal ===
The magnitude and speed of dose reduction in corticosteroid withdrawal should be determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the underlying condition being treated, and individual patient factors such as the likelihood of relapse and the duration of corticosteroid treatment. Gradual withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids should be considered in those whose disease is unlikely to relapse and have:

* received more than 40&nbsp;mg prednisone (or equivalent) daily for more than 1 week
* been given repeat doses in the evening;
* received more than 3 weeks' treatment
* recently received repeated courses (particularly if taken for longer than 3 weeks)
* taken a short course within 1 year of stopping long-term therapy
* other possible causes of adrenal suppression

Systemic corticosteroids may be stopped abruptly in those whose disease is unlikely to relapse and who have received treatment for 3 weeks or less and who are not included in the patient groups described above.

During corticosteroid withdrawal, the dose may be reduced rapidly down to physiological doses (equivalent to prednisolone 7.5&nbsp;mg daily) and then reduced more slowly. Assessment of the disease may be needed during withdrawal to ensure that relapse does not occur.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Iliopoulou|first=Amalia|last2=Abbas|first2=Afroze|last3=Murray|first3=Robert|date=2013-05-19|title=How to manage withdrawal of glucocorticoid therapy|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/psb.1060/abstract|journal=Prescriber|language=en|volume=24|issue=10|pages=23–29|doi=10.1002/psb.1060|issn=1931-2253}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
Prednisone has no substantial biological effects until converted via hepatic metabolism to [[prednisolone]].<ref>[http://druginfo.nlm.nih.gov/drugportal/ProxyServlet?mergeData=true&objectHandle=DBMaint&APPLICATION_NAME=drugportal&actionHandle=default&nextPage=jsp/drugportal/ResultScreen.jsp&TXTSUPERLISTID=0000053032&QV1=PREDNISONE Medline drug information for prednisone]</ref>

==Effects of MPT==
Multiple studies have found the MPT to be a key factor in the damage to neurons caused by [[excitotoxicity]].<ref name="Ichas and Mazat" /><ref name="Schinder"/><ref name="White and Reynolds"/>

The induction of MPT, which increases mitochondrial membrane permeability, causes mitochondria to become further depolarized, meaning that Δψ is abolished. When Δψ is lost, [[proton]]s and some molecules are able to flow across the outer mitochondrial membrane uninhibited.<ref name="Schinder" /><ref name="White and Reynolds" />
Loss of Δψ interferes with the production of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), the cell's main source of energy, because mitochondria must have an [[electrochemical gradient]] to provide the driving force for ATP production.

In cell damage resulting from conditions such as [[neurodegenerative disease]]s and [[head injury]], opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore can greatly reduce ATP production, and can cause [[ATP synthase]] to begin [[hydrolysis|hydrolysing]], rather than producing, ATP.<ref name="Stavrovskaya and Kristal">{{Cite journal

MPT also allows Ca<sup>2+</sup> to leave the mitochondrion, which can place further stress on nearby mitochondria, and which can activate harmful calcium-dependent [[protease]]s such as [[calpain]].

[[Reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) are also produced as a result of opening the MPT pore.  MPT can allow [[antioxidant]] molecules such as [[glutathione]] to exit mitochondria, reducing the organelles' ability to neutralize ROS.  In addition, the [[electron transport chain]] (ETC) may produce more free radicals due to loss of components of the ETC, such as [[cytochrome c|cytochrome ''c'']], through the MPTP.<ref name="luetjens">{{Cite journal

Much research has found that the fate of the cell after an insult depends on the extent of MPT.  If MPT occurs to only a slight extent, the cell may recover, whereas if it occurs more it may undergo apoptosis. If it occurs to an even larger degree the cell is likely to undergo [[necrosis|necrotic cell death]].<ref name="Honda "/>

==Possible evolutionary purpose of the MPTP==

There is controversy about the question of whether the MPTP is able to exist in a harmless, "low-conductance" state. This low-conductance state would not induce MPT<ref name="Ichas and Mazat"/> and would allow certain molecules and ions to cross the mitochondrial membranes. The low-conductance state may allow small ions like Ca<sup>2+</sup> to leave mitochondria quickly, in order to aid in the cycling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in healthy cells.<ref name="Hunter and Hayworth 1979b">{{Cite journal

Sodium '''saccharin''' (benzoic sulfimide) is an [[artificial sweetener]] with effectively no [[food energy]] that is about 300–400 times as sweet as [[sucrose]] but has a bitter or metallic [[aftertaste]], especially at high concentrations.  It is used to sweeten products such as drinks, candies, cookies, and medicines.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.drugs.com/inactive/saccharin-172.html | title = Saccharin (Inactive Ingredient) | publisher = drugs.com}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Saccharin derives its name from the word "saccharine", meaning "sugary".  The word saccharine is used figuratively, often in a derogative sense, to describe something "unpleasantly over-polite" or "overly sweet".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/saccharine | title = Saccharine | publisher = reference.com}}</ref> Both words are derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word σάκχαρον (''sakcharon'') meaning "gravel".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=saccharine | title = Saccharine | publisher = etymonline.com}}</ref>  Related, [[saccharose]] is the name for table sugar.

==Properties==
[[File:Saccharin-Na substance photo.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sodium salt of saccharin, a white powder]]
Saccharin is heat stable.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} It does not react chemically with other food ingredients; as such, it stores well. Blends of saccharin with other sweeteners are often used to compensate for each sweetener's weaknesses and faults. A 10:1 [[cyclamate]]:saccharin blend is common in countries where both these sweeteners are legal; in this blend, each sweetener masks the other's off taste.  Saccharin is often used  with [[aspartame]] in diet carbonated soft drinks, so  some sweetness remains should the fountain syrup be stored beyond aspartame's relatively short shelf life.
  
In its acid form, saccharin is not water-soluble.  The form used as an artificial sweetener is usually its [[sodium]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chattopadhyay|first1=S|last2=Raychaudhuri|first2=U|last3=Chakraborty|first3=R|title=Artificial sweeteners – a review.|journal=Journal of food science and technology|date=April 2014|volume=51|issue=4|pages=611–21|pmid=24741154|pmc=3982014}}</ref> The [[calcium]] salt is also sometimes used, especially by people restricting their dietary sodium intake.

==History==
[[File:Süßstoff Saccharin Zucker-Museum.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Saccharin, historical wrapping, [[Sugar Museum (Berlin)]]]]

Saccharin was produced first in 1879, by [[Constantin Fahlberg]], a chemist working on [[coal tar]] derivatives in [[Ira Remsen]]'s laboratory at the [[Johns Hopkins University]].<ref>(As discussed below, the relative contributions of Fahlberg and Remsen to the discovery were later contested, with no final resolution in sight; the 1879 paper announcing the discovery lists both names as authors, with Fahlberg's name first.)</ref> Fahlberg noticed a sweet taste on his hand one evening, and connected this with the compound benzoic sulfimide on which he had been working that day.<ref>Fahlberg's account of how he discovered the sweetness of saccharin appears in:  (Anon.) (July 17, 1886) [https://books.google.com/books?id=f4I9AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA36#v=onepage&q&f=false "The inventor of saccharine,"] ''Scientific American'', new series, '''60''' (3) :  36.</ref><ref name="isbn0-313-33758-6">{{cite book |author1=Myers, Rusty L. |author2=Myers, Richard L. |title=The 100 most important chemical compounds: a reference guide |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn |year=2007 |pages=241 |isbn=0-313-33758-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Fahlberg and Remsen published articles on benzoic sulfimide in 1879 and 1880.<ref name = "Fahlberg"/><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Remsen Ira |author2=Fahlberg C. | year = February 1880 | title = On the oxidation of substitution products of aromatic hydrocarbons.

The taste is perfectly pure.  The minutest quantity of the substance, a bit of its powder scarcely visible, if placed upon the tip of the tongue, causes a sensation of pleasant sweetness throughout the entire cavity of the mouth.  As stated above, the substance is soluble to only a slight extent in cold water, but if a few drops of the cold aqueous solution be placed in an ordinary goblet full of water, the latter then tastes like the sweetest syrup.  Its presence can hence easily be detected in the dilutest solutions by the taste."</ref> In 1884, then working on his own in [[New York City]], Fahlberg applied for patents in several countries, describing methods of producing this substance that he named saccharin.<ref>Constantin Fahlberg and Adolph List, [http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00319082 "Manufacture of saccharine compounds,"] U.S. Patent no. 319,082 (filed:  August 7, 1884).</ref> Two years later, he began production of the substance in a factory in a suburb of [[Magdeburg, Germany]].  Fahlberg would soon grow wealthy, while Remsen merely grew irritated, believing he deserved credit for substances produced in his laboratory. On the matter, Remsen commented, "Fahlberg is a scoundrel. It nauseates me to hear my name mentioned in the same breath with him."<ref>{{Cite book|publisher= Journal of chemical education |publication-place= Easton, Pa |title= The life of Ira Remsen |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL6411359M/The_life_of_Ira_Remsen |author = Getman, Frederick Hutton |publication-date= 1940 |page=66 |oclc = 2640159 |postscript= <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Although saccharin was commercialized not long after its discovery, until sugar shortages during [[World War I]], its use had not become widespread. Its popularity further increased during the 1960s and 1970s among dieters, since saccharin is a [[calorie]]-free sweetener. In the United States, saccharin is often found in restaurants in [[pink]] packets; the most popular brand is "[[Sweet'n Low]]".
Because of the difficulty of importing sugar from the West Indies The British Saccharin Company was founded in 1917 to produce Saccharin at its Paragon Works near Accrington, Lancashire. Production was licensed and controlled by the Board of Trade in London. Production continued on the site until 1926.

===Government regulation===
Starting in 1907, the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] began investigating saccharin as a result of the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]]. [[Harvey Wiley]], then the director of the bureau of chemistry for the FDA, viewed it as an illegal substitution of a valuable ingredient (sugar) by a less valuable ingredient. In a clash that had career consequences, Wiley told President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], "Everyone who ate that sweet corn was deceived. He thought he was eating sugar, when in point of fact he was eating a coal tar product totally devoid of food value and extremely injurious to health." But Roosevelt himself was a consumer of saccharin, and, in a heated exchange, Roosevelt angrily answered Wiley by stating, "Anybody who says saccharin is injurious to health is an idiot."  The episode proved the undoing of Wiley's career.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/ProductRegulation/SelectionsFromFDLIUpdateSeriesonFDAHistory/ucm091680.htm |title=Sugar: A Cautionary Tale |publisher=www.fda.gov |accessdate=2010-06-20 }}</ref>

In 1911, Food Inspection Decision 135 stated that foods containing saccharin were adulterated.<ref name="Dunn1913">{{cite book|author=Charles Wesley Dunn|title=Federal, State, and Territorial Reference Manual of Pure Food and Drug Law: Dunn's Pure Food and Drug Legal Manual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P34sAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA1327|year=1913|publisher=Dunn's pure food and drug legal manual corporation|pages=1327–}}</ref> However, in 1912, Food Inspection Decision 142 stated that saccharin was not harmful.<ref name="Health1921">{{cite book|author=California State Board of Health|title=Monthly Bulletin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=swBFAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA21|year=1921|publisher=The Board.|pages=21–}}</ref>

More controversy was stirred in 1969 with the discovery of files from the FDA's investigations of 1948 and 1949. These investigations, which had originally argued against saccharin use, were shown to prove little about saccharin being harmful to human health.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} In 1977, the FDA made an attempt to completely ban the substance,<ref name=Priebem/><ref name=Conis/> following studies showing that the substance caused cancer in rats. The attempted ban was unsuccessful due to public opposition that was encouraged by industry advertisements,<ref name=Conis/> and instead the following label was mandated: "Use of this product may be hazardous to your health. This product contains saccharin which has been determined to cause cancer in laboratory animals". That requirement was dropped in 2000 following new research that concluded humans reacted differently than rats and were not at risk of cancer at typical intake levels.<ref name=Conis/> (''See also'': [[Saccharin#Warning label addition and removal|labeling]] below.) The sweetener has continued to be widely used in the United States and is now the third-most popular artificial sweetener behind [[sucralose]] and [[aspartame]].

In the European Union, saccharin is also known by the [[E number]] (additive code) E954.

The current status of saccharin is that it is allowed in most countries, and countries such as Canada have lifted their previous ban of it as a food additive.<ref>[http://www.agcanada.com/daily/saccharin-cleared-for-use-in-foods-in-canada], [[Health Canada]]</ref> The claims that it is associated with bladder cancer were shown to be unfounded in experiments on primates.<ref name="Takayama-1998">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Takayama | first1 = S. | last2 = Sieber | first2 = SM. | last3 = Adamson | first3 = RH. | last4 = Thorgeirsson | first4 = UP. | last5 = Dalgard | first5 = DW. | last6 = Arnold | first6 = LL. | last7 = Cano | first7 = M. | last8 = Eklund | first8 = S. | last9 = Cohen | first9 = SM. | title = Long-term feeding of sodium saccharin to nonhuman primates: implications for urinary tract cancer | journal = J Natl Cancer Inst | volume = 90 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–25 |date=Jan 1998 | doi = 10.1093/jnci/90.1.19| pmid = 9428778  }}</ref> (It is, however, prohibited to mail saccharin tablets or packets to France.)<ref>http://pe.usps.com/text/imm/fh_005.htm USPS Mailing Conditions</ref>

Saccharin was formerly on California's list of chemicals known to the state to cause cancer for the purposes of [[California Proposition 65 (1986)|Proposition 65]], but it was delisted in 2001.<ref>[http://www.oehha.ca.gov/prop65/CRNR_notices/chemicals_reconsideration/fdelistsacc.html Chemicals Delisted Effective April 6, 2001 as Known to the State to Cause Cancer], [[California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment]]</ref>

In 1958, the United States Congress amended the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act|Food, Drugs, and Cosmetic Act of 1938]] with the [[Delaney clause]] to mandate that the [[Food and Drug Administration]] not approve substances that "induce cancer in man, or, after tests, [are] found to induce cancer in animals."  Studies in laboratory rats during the early 1970s linked saccharin with the development of bladder cancer in rodents. As a consequence, all food containing saccharin was labeled with a warning meeting the requirement of the [[Saccharin Study and Labeling Act of 1977]].<ref>{{cite news | date=1973-05-22 | accessdate=2011-06-09 | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=moBFAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-LwMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6480,3710197&dq=saccharin+warning&hl=en | title=Saccharin warning | work=AP via Telegraph-Herald }}</ref>

However, in 2000, the warning labels were removed because scientists learned that rodents, unlike humans, have a unique combination of high pH, high calcium phosphate, and high protein levels in their urine.<ref name="Whysner-1996">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Whysner | first1 = J. | last2 = Williams | first2 = GM. | title = Saccharin mechanistic data and risk assessment: urine composition, enhanced cell proliferation, and tumor promotion | journal = Pharmacol Ther | volume = 71 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 225–52 | year = 1996 | doi = 10.1016/0163-7258(96)00069-1| pmid = 8910956 }}</ref><ref name="Dybing-2002">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Dybing | first1 = E. | title = Development and implementation of the IPCS conceptual framework for evaluating mode of action of chemical carcinogens | journal = Toxicology | volume = 181–182 | issue = | pages = 121–5 |date=Dec 2002 | doi = 10.1016/S0300-483X(02)00266-4| pmid = 12505296 }}</ref> One or more of the proteins that are more prevalent in male rats combine with calcium phosphate and saccharin to produce microcrystals that damage the lining of the bladder.

In a December 14, 2010 release, the EPA stated that saccharin is no longer considered a potential hazard to human health.<ref>[http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/d0cf6618525a9efb85257359003fb69d/ea895a11ea50a56d852577f9005e2690!OpenDocument "EPA Removes Saccharin from Hazardous Substances Listing."] December 14, 2010, accessed January 14, 2011.</ref>

|Risperidone seems to produce somewhat more [[Extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal]] side effects and clearly more prolactin increase than most other [[atypical antipsychotic]]s. It may also differ from other compounds in the occurrence of other adverse effects such as weight gain, metabolic problems, cardiac effects, sedation and seizures.

[[File:Risperidone icon.svg|thumb|right|Risperidone pharmacodynamics excluding <small>D</small>-amino acid oxidase inhibition]]

Risperidone has been classified as a "qualitatively atypical" antipsychotic agent with a relatively low incidence of [[Extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal side effects]] (when given at low doses) that has more pronounced [[serotonin antagonism]] than [[Dopamine antagonist|dopamine antagonism]]. Risperidone contains the [[functional group]]s of [[benzisoxazole]] and [[piperidine]] as part of its molecular structure. Although not a butyrophenone, it was developed with the structures of [[benperidol]] and [[ketanserin]] as a basis. It has actions at several 5-HT ([[serotonin]]) [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] subtypes. These are 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>, linked to weight gain, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, linked to its antipsychotic action and relief of some of the extrapyramidal side effects experienced with the typical neuroleptics.<ref name = "GG">Brunton L, Chabner B, Knollman B. Goodman and Gilman’s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Twelfth Edition. McGraw Hill Professional; 2010.</ref>

It was recently found that [[D-amino acid oxidase|<small>D</small>-amino acid oxidase]], the enzyme that catalyses the breakdown of <small>D</small>-amino acids (e.g. [[D-alanine|<small>D</small>-alanine]] and [[D-serine|<small>D</small>-serine]] — the neurotransmitters) is inhibited by risperidone.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Abou El-Magd RM, Park HK, Kawazoe T, Iwana S, Ono K, Chung SP, Miyano M, Yorita K, Sakai T, Fukui K | title = The effect of risperidone on D-amino acid oxidase activity as a hypothesis for a novel mechanism of action in the treatment of schizophrenia | journal = Journal of Psychopharmacology | volume = 24 | issue = 7 | pages = 1055–1067  | date = July 2010 | pmid = 19329549 | doi = 10.1177/0269881109102644 }}</ref>

Risperidone acts on the following receptors:

'''[[Dopamine receptor]]s''': This drug is an antagonist of the D<sub>1</sub> (D<sub>1</sub>, and D<sub>5</sub>) as well as the D<sub>2</sub> family (D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub> and D<sub>4</sub>) receptors. This drug has "tight binding" properties, which means it has a long half-life and like other antipsychotics, risperidone blocks the mesolimbic pathway, the prefrontal cortex limbic pathway, and the tuberoinfundibular pathway in the central nervous system. Risperidone may induce extrapyramidal side effects, [[akathisia]] and [[tremor]]s, associated with diminished dopaminergic activity in the [[striatum]]. It can also cause sexual side effects, [[galactorrhoea]], infertility, [[gynecomastia]] and, with chronic use reduced bone mineral density leading to [[Bone fracture|breaks]] all of which are associated with increased prolactin secretion.<ref name = "GG" />

'''[[Serotonin receptor]]s''': Its action at these receptors may be responsible for its lower extrapyramidal side effect liability (via the 5-HT<sub>2A/2C</sub> receptors) and improved negative symptom control compared to typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol for instance. Its antagonistic actions at the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor may account, in part, for its weight gain liability.

'''[[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|Alpha α<sub>1</sub> adrenergic receptors]]''': This action accounts for its orthostatic hypotensive effects and perhaps some of the sedating effects of risperidone.<ref name = "GG" />

'''[[Alpha-2 Adrenergic receptor|Alpha α<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptors]]''': Perhaps greater positive, negative, affective and cognitive symptom control.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hecht EM, Landy DC | year = 2012 | title = Alpha-2 receptor antagonist add-on therapy in the treatment of schizophrenia; a meta-analysis | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920996411006281 | journal = Schizophrenia Research | volume = 134 | issue = 2–3| pages = 202–6 | doi=10.1016/j.schres.2011.11.030 | pmid=22169246}}</ref>

'''[[Histamine H1 receptor|Histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors]]''': effects on these receptors account for its sedation and reduction in vigilance. This may also lead to drowsiness and weight gain.<ref name = "GG" />

Though this medication possesses similar effects to other typical and atypical antipsychotics, it does not possess an affinity for the [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptors]]. In many respects, this medication can be useful as an "[[acetylcholine]] release-promoter" similar to gastrointestinal drugs such as [[metoclopramide]] and [[cisapride]].

===Pharmacokinetics===
Risperidone undergoes hepatic metabolism and renal excretion. Lower doses are recommended for patients with severe liver and kidney disease.<ref name="FDA Prescribing Info Label" />  The [[active metabolite]] of risperidone, [[paliperidone]], is also used as an antipsychotic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01267|title=The DrugBank database|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117205610/http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01267|archivedate=2011-11-17|df=}}</ref>

Topical cocaine can be used as a local [[anesthetic|numbing agent]] to help with painful procedures in the mouth or nose.<ref name="Dwyer2016">{{cite journal|last1=Dwyer|first1=C|last2=Sowerby|first2=L|last3=Rotenberg|first3=BW|title=Is cocaine a safe topical agent for use during endoscopic sinus surgery?|journal=Laryngoscope|date=August 2016|volume=126|issue=8|pages=1721–3|doi=10.1002/lary.25836|pmid=27075241|type=Review}}</ref> [[Topical tac|TAC]] is one such formulation used for pediatrics.

Cocaine is now predominantly used for nasal and [[lacrimal duct]] surgery. The major disadvantages of this use are cocaine's potential for [[cardiovascular]] toxicity, [[glaucoma]], and [[mydriasis|pupil dilation]].<ref name="Dwyer2016"/> Medicinal use of cocaine has decreased as other synthetic local anesthetics such as [[benzocaine]], [[proparacaine]], [[lidocaine]], and [[tetracaine]] are now used more often.<ref name="Dwyer2016"/> If vasoconstriction is desired for a procedure (as it reduces bleeding), the anesthetic is combined with a vasoconstrictor such as [[phenylephrine]] or [[epinephrine]]. Some [[otolaryngology|ENT]] specialists occasionally use cocaine within the practice when performing procedures such as nasal [[cauterization]]. In this scenario dissolved cocaine is soaked into a ball of cotton wool, which is placed in the nostril for the 10–15&nbsp;minutes immediately before the procedure, thus performing the dual role of both numbing the area to be cauterized, and vasoconstriction. Even when used this way, some of the used cocaine may be absorbed through oral or nasal mucosa and give systemic effects.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} An alternative method of administration for ENT surgery is mixed with [[adrenaline]] and [[sodium bicarbonate]], as [[Moffett's solution]].

===Recreational===

Cocaine use leads to increases in alertness, feelings of well-being and [[euphoria]], increased energy and motor activity, and increased feelings of competence and sexuality.<ref name="Donroe2017">{{cite journal|last1=Donroe|first1=JH|last2=Tetrault|first2=JM|title=Substance Use, Intoxication, and Withdrawal in the Critical Care Setting|journal=Critical Care Clinics|date=July 2017|volume=33|issue=3|pages=543–58|doi=10.1016/j.ccc.2017.03.003|pmid=28601134|type=Review}}</ref>

====Oral====
[[File:Crack Crack.JPG|thumb|A spoon containing baking soda, cocaine, and a small amount of water. Used in a "poor-man's" crack-cocaine production]]

Many users rub the powder along the gum line, or onto a cigarette filter which is then smoked, which numbs the gums and teeth – hence the colloquial names of "numbies", "gummers", or "cocoa puffs" for this type of administration. This is mostly done with the small amounts of cocaine remaining on a surface after insufflation (snorting). Another oral method is to wrap up some cocaine in rolling paper and swallow ([[parachute (drugs)|parachute]]) it.

=====Coca leaves=====
[[Coca]] leaves are typically mixed with an alkaline substance (such as [[calcium hydroxide|lime]]) and chewed into a wad that is retained in the mouth between gum and cheek (much the same as [[chewing tobacco]] is chewed) and sucked of its juices. The juices are absorbed slowly by the mucous membrane of the inner cheek and by the gastrointestinal tract when swallowed. Alternatively, coca leaves can be infused in liquid and consumed like tea. Ingesting coca leaves generally is an inefficient means of administering cocaine.

Because cocaine is [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] and rendered inactive in the acidic stomach, it is not readily absorbed when ingested alone. Only when mixed with a highly alkaline substance (such as lime) can it be absorbed into the bloodstream through the stomach. The efficiency of absorption of orally administered cocaine is limited by two additional factors. First, the drug is partly catabolized by the liver. Second, capillaries in the mouth and esophagus constrict after contact with the drug, reducing the surface area over which the drug can be absorbed. Nevertheless, cocaine metabolites can be detected in the urine of subjects that have sipped even one cup of coca leaf infusion.

Orally administered cocaine takes approximately 30&nbsp;minutes to enter the bloodstream. Typically, only a third of an oral dose is absorbed, although absorption has been shown to reach 60% in controlled settings. Given the slow rate of absorption, maximum [[physiological]] and [[psychotropic]] effects are attained approximately 60&nbsp;minutes after cocaine is administered by ingestion. While the onset of these effects is slow, the effects are sustained for approximately 60&nbsp;minutes after their peak is attained.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Contrary to popular belief, both ingestion and [[insufflation]] result in approximately the same proportion of the drug being absorbed: 30 to 60%. Compared to ingestion, the faster absorption of insufflated cocaine results in quicker attainment of maximum drug effects. Snorting cocaine produces maximum physiological effects within 40&nbsp;minutes and maximum psychotropic effects within 20&nbsp;minutes, however, a more realistic activation period is closer to 5 to 10&nbsp;minutes. Physiological and psychotropic effects from nasally insufflated cocaine are sustained for approximately 40–60&nbsp;minutes after the peak effects are attained.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Barnett |first1= G |last2= Hawks |first2= R |last3= Resnick |first3= R |title= Cocaine pharmacokinetics in humans |journal= Journal of Ethnopharmacology |volume= 3 |issue= 2–3 |pages= 353–66 |year= 1981 |pmid= 7242115 |doi=10.1016/0378-8741(81)90063-5 }}; Jones, supra note 19; Wilkinson ''et al.'', Van Dyke ''et al.''</ref>

[[Coca tea]], an infusion of coca leaves, is also a traditional method of consumption. The tea has often been recommended for travelers in the Andes to prevent [[altitude sickness]].<ref name=luks>{{cite journal |last=Luks |first=Andrew M. |url=http://oyyum.net/Wilderness/pdf/wilderness-medical.pdf |title=Wilderness Medical Society Consensus Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Acute Altitude Illness |publisher=Wilderness & Environmental Medicine |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=146–155 |year=2010 |doi=10.1016/j.wem.2010.03.002 |journal=Wilderness |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015131014/http://oyyum.net/Wilderness/pdf/wilderness-medical.pdf |archivedate=15 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }} {{link note|note=mirror: [http://brad-jackson.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Wilderness-Medicine-Guidelines-for-Treatment-of-Acute-Altitude-Illness-2010.pdf]}}</ref> However, its actual effectiveness has never been systematically studied.<ref name=luks /> This method of consumption has been practised for many centuries by the indigenous tribes of South America. One specific purpose of ancient coca leaf consumption was to increase energy and reduce fatigue in messengers who made multi-day quests to other settlements.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In 1986 an article in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' revealed that U.S. [[health food store]]s were selling dried coca leaves to be prepared as an infusion as "Health Inca Tea."<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Siegel RK, Elsohly MA, Plowman T, Rury PM, Jones RT |title=Cocaine in herbal tea|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|date=3 January 1986|volume=255|issue=1| page=40 |doi=10.1001/jama.255.1.40|pmid=3940302}}</ref> While the packaging claimed it had been "decocainized", no such process had actually taken place. The article stated that drinking two cups of the tea per day gave a mild [[stimulation]], increased [[heart rate]], and [[emotional mood|mood]] elevation, and the tea was essentially harmless. Despite this, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] seized several shipments in [[Hawaii]], [[Chicago]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and several locations on the [[East Coast of the United States]], and the product was removed from the shelves.

====Insufflation====
[[File:Cocaine lines 2.jpg|thumb|Lines of cocaine prepared for insufflation]]
Nasal [[insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]] (known colloquially as "snorting", "sniffing", or "blowing") is a common method of ingestion of recreational powdered cocaine.<ref>{{cite web|title=DrugFacts: Cocaine|url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/cocaine|publisher=National Institute on Drug Abuse|accessdate=11 July 2015|date=April 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711234545/http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/cocaine|archivedate=11 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The drug coats and is absorbed through the [[mucous membrane]]s lining the [[nasal passages]]. Cocaine's desired euphoric effects are delayed when snorted through the nose by about five minutes. This occurs because cocaine's absorption is slowed by its constricting effect on the blood vessels of the nose.<ref name="Zimmerman2012"/> Insufflation of cocaine also leads to the longest duration of its effects (60–90 minutes).<ref name="Zimmerman2012"/> When insufflating cocaine, absorption through the nasal membranes is approximately 30–60%, with higher doses leading to increased absorption efficiency. Any material not directly absorbed through the mucous membranes is collected in [[mucus]] and swallowed (this "drip" is considered pleasant by some and unpleasant by others).

In a study of cocaine users, the average time taken to reach peak subjective effects was 14.6&nbsp;minutes.<ref name="Volkow">{{cite journal|author=Nora D. Volkow|title=Effects of route of administration on cocaine induced dopamine transporter blockade in the human brain|pmid=10983846|year=2000|journal=Life Sciences|volume=67|issue=12|pages=1507–1515|doi=10.1016/S0024-3205(00)00731-1|display-authors=1 |last2=Wang|first2=Gene.-Jack|last3=Fischman|first3=Marian W.|last4=Foltin|first4=Richard|last5=Fowler|first5=Joanna S. |last6=Franceschi |first6=Dinko|last7=Franceschi|first7=Maja|last8=Logan|first8=Jean|last9=Gatley|first9=Samuel J. |last10=Wong |first10=Christopher |last11=Ding|first11=Yu-Shin|last12=Hitzemann|first12=Robert|last13=Pappas|first13=Naomi}}</ref> Any damage to the inside of the nose is because cocaine highly constricts blood vessels – and therefore blood and oxygen/nutrient flow – to that area.

Rolled up [[currency|banknotes]], hollowed-out [[pen]]s, cut [[drinking straw|straws]], pointed ends of keys, specialized spoons, long [[fingernails]], and (clean) tampon applicators are often used to insufflate cocaine. Such devices are often called "tooters" by users. The cocaine typically is poured onto a flat, hard surface (such as a mirror, CD case or book) and divided into "bumps", "lines" or "rails", and then insufflated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cesar.umd.edu/cesar/drugs/cocaine.asp#Terminology |title=Cocaine terminology |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709115212/http://www.cesar.umd.edu/cesar/drugs/cocaine.asp#Terminology |archivedate=9 July 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The amount of cocaine in a line varies widely from person to person and occasion to occasion (the purity of the cocaine is also a factor), but one line is generally considered to be a single dose and is typically 35&nbsp;mg (a "bump") to 100&nbsp;mg (a "rail").{{Dubious|Numbers Missing:Size of Lines, Bumps and Rails|date=September 2012}} As tolerance builds rapidly in the short-term (hours), many lines are often snorted to produce greater effects.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} A 2001 study reported that the sharing of straws used to "snort" cocaine can spread blood diseases such as [[hepatitis C]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bonkovsky HL, Mehta S |title=Hepatitis C: a review and update |journal=J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=159–182 |year=2001|pmid=11174373 |doi=10.1067/mjd.2001.109311}}</ref>

====Injection====
[[Drug injection]] by turning the drug into a solution provides the highest blood levels of drug in the shortest amount of time. Subjective effects not commonly shared with other methods of administration include a ringing in the ears moments after injection (usually when in excess of 120&nbsp;milligrams) lasting 2 to 5&nbsp;minutes including [[tinnitus]] and audio distortion. This is colloquially referred to as a "bell ringer". In a study of cocaine users, the average time taken to reach peak subjective effects was 3.1&nbsp;minutes.<ref name="Volkow" /> The euphoria passes quickly. Aside from the toxic effects of cocaine, there is also danger of circulatory [[embolism|emboli]] from the insoluble substances that may be used to cut the drug. As with all injected illicit substances, there is a risk of the user contracting blood-borne infections if sterile injecting equipment is not available or used. Additionally, because cocaine is a vasoconstrictor, and usage often entails multiple injections within several hours or less, subsequent injections are progressively more difficult to administer, which in turn may lead to more injection attempts and more consequences from improperly performed injection.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

An injected mixture of cocaine and [[heroin]], known as "[[speedball (drug)|speedball]]" is a particularly dangerous combination, as the converse effects of the drugs actually complement each other, but may also mask the symptoms of an overdose. It has been responsible for numerous deaths, including celebrities such as  comedians/actors [[John Belushi]] and [[Chris Farley]], [[Mitch Hedberg]], [[River Phoenix]], grunge singer  [[Layne Staley]] and actor [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]]. Experimentally, cocaine injections can be delivered to animals such as [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] to study the mechanisms of cocaine addiction.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Dimitrijevic N, Dzitoyeva S, Manev H |title=An automated assay of the behavioral effects of cocaine injections in adult Drosophila|journal=J Neurosci Methods|year=2004|volume=137|issue=2|pages=181–184|pmid=15262059|doi=10.1016/j.jneumeth.2004.02.023}}</ref>

====Inhalation====
{{See also|Crack cocaine}}
Inhalation by smoking cocaine is one of the several ways the drug is consumed. The onset of cocaine's desired euphoric effects is fastest with inhaling cocaine and begins after 3–5 seconds.<ref name="Zimmerman2012"/> In contrast, inhalation of cocaine leads to the shortest duration of its effects (5–15 minutes).<ref name="Zimmerman2012"/> The two main ways cocaine is smoked are [[Crack cocaine|freebasing]] and by using cocaine which has been converted to smokable "[[crack cocaine]]".

Smoking freebase or crack cocaine is most often accomplished using a pipe made from a small glass tube, often taken from "[[love rose]]s", small glass tubes with a paper rose that are promoted as romantic gifts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.journalstar.com/news/local/article_28e66c86-1ef8-52dc-ac0a-f3933ed6ec5a.html|title=A rose by another name: crack pipe|newspaper=[[Lincoln Journal Star]]|author=Margaret Reist|date=16 January 2005|accessdate=21 August 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726074900/http://journalstar.com/news/local/article_28e66c86-1ef8-52dc-ac0a-f3933ed6ec5a.html|archivedate=26 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> These are sometimes called "stems", "horns", "blasters" and "straight shooters". A small piece of clean heavy copper or occasionally stainless steel scouring pad{{spaced ndash}}often called a "brillo" (actual [[Brillo Pad]]s contain soap, and are not used) or "chore" (named for [[Chore Boy]] brand copper scouring pads){{spaced ndash}}serves as a reduction base and flow modulator in which the "rock" can be melted and boiled to vapor. Crack smokers also sometimes smoke through a [[soda can]] with small holes on the side or bottom.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Crack is smoked by placing it at the end of the pipe; a flame held close to it produces vapor, which is then inhaled by the smoker.

====Suppository====
Another way users consume cocaine is by making it into a [[suppository]] which they then insert into the anus or vagina. The drug is then absorbed by the membranes of these body parts. Little research has been focused on the suppository (anal or vaginal insertion) method of administration, also known as "plugging". This method of administration is commonly administered using an [[oral syringe]]. Cocaine can be dissolved in water and withdrawn into an oral syringe which may then be lubricated and inserted into the anus or vagina before the plunger is pushed. Anecdotal evidence of its effects is infrequently discussed, possibly due to social taboos in many cultures. The rectum and the vaginal canal is where the majority of the drug would be taken up through the membranes lining its walls.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

[[File:Side effects of chronic use of Cocaine.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Side effects of chronic cocaine use]]

Chronic cocaine intake causes strong imbalances of transmitter levels in order to compensate extremes. Thus, receptors disappear from the cell surface or reappear on it, resulting more or less in an "off" or "working mode" respectively, or they change their susceptibility for binding partners (ligands){{spaced ndash}}mechanisms called [[downregulation and upregulation]]. However, studies suggest cocaine abusers do not show normal age-related loss of [[striatum|striatal]] [[dopamine transporter]] (DAT) sites, suggesting cocaine has neuroprotective properties for dopamine neurons.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biological Psychiatry |editor1=Hugo D'haenen |editor2=Johan A. den Boer |editor3=P. Willner|publisher=Wiley |volume=2|edition=2|isbn=978-0-471-49198-9|year=2002 |page=528}}</ref> Possible side effects include insatiable hunger, aches, insomnia/oversleeping, lethargy, and persistent runny nose. Depression with suicidal ideation may develop in very heavy users. Finally, a loss of [[vesicular monoamine transporter]]s, neurofilament proteins, and other morphological changes appear to indicate a long term damage of dopamine neurons. All these effects contribute a rise in tolerance thus requiring a larger dosage to achieve the same effect.<ref name="Substance Abuse Textbook">{{cite book |title=Substance abuse: a comprehensive textbook |last=Lowinson |first=Joyce, H |author2=Ruiz, Pedro |author3=Millman, Robert B. |year=2004 |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |edition=4th |isbn=978-0-7817-3474-5 |page=204 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HtGb2wNsgn4C&pg=PA204#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=5 January 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404152414/http://books.google.com/books?id=HtGb2wNsgn4C&pg=PA204#v=onepage&q&f=false |archivedate=4 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
The lack of normal amounts of serotonin and dopamine in the brain is the cause of the dysphoria and depression felt after the initial high. Physical withdrawal is not dangerous. Physiological changes caused by cocaine withdrawal include vivid and unpleasant dreams, insomnia or hypersomnia, increased appetite and psychomotor retardation or agitation.<ref name="Substance Abuse Textbook" />

Physical side effects from chronic smoking of cocaine include [[hemoptysis|coughing up blood]], [[bronchospasm]], [[pruritus|itching]], [[fever]], diffuse alveolar infiltrates without effusions, pulmonary and systemic [[eosinophilia]], chest pain, lung trauma, sore throat, [[asthma]], hoarse voice, [[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath), and an aching, [[flu]]-like syndrome. Cocaine [[Vasoconstriction|constricts blood vessels]], [[Mydriasis|dilates pupils]], and increases body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. It can also cause headaches and gastrointestinal complications such as abdominal pain and nausea. A common but untrue belief is that the smoking of cocaine chemically breaks down [[tooth enamel]] and causes [[tooth decay]]. However, cocaine does often cause involuntary tooth grinding, known as [[bruxism]], which can deteriorate tooth enamel and lead to [[gingivitis]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Baigent |first=Michael|year=2003|title=Physical complications of substance abuse: what the psychiatrist needs to know |journal=Curr Opin Psychiatry |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=291–296|doi=10.1097/00001504-200305000-00004}}</ref> Additionally, stimulants like cocaine, methamphetamine, and even caffeine cause dehydration and [[Xerostomia|dry mouth]]. Since saliva is an important mechanism in maintaining one's oral pH level, chronic stimulant abusers who do not hydrate sufficiently may experience demineralization of their teeth due to the pH of the tooth surface dropping too low (below 5.5). Cocaine use also promotes the [[thrombosis|formation of blood clots]].<ref name="Zimmerman2012"/> This increase in blood clot formation is attributed to cocaine-associated increases in the activity of [[Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1|plasminogen activator inhibitor]], and an increase in the number, activation, and aggregation of [[platelet]]s.<ref name="Zimmerman2012"/>

Chronic intranasal usage can degrade the [[cartilage]] separating the [[nostrils]] (the [[septum nasi]]), leading eventually to its complete disappearance.

===Addiction===
{{see also|Epigenetics of cocaine addiction}}
[[Cocaine addiction]] occurs through [[ΔFosB]] overexpression in the [[nucleus accumbens]], which results in altered [[transcriptional regulation]] in neurons within the [[nucleus accumbens]].

ΔFosB levels have been found to increase upon the use of cocaine.<ref name="pmid9668659">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hope BT | title = Cocaine and the AP-1 transcription factor complex | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 844 | issue =  | pages = 1–6 | date = May 1998 | pmid = 9668659 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb08216.x }}</ref> Each subsequent dose of cocaine continues to increase ΔFosB levels with no ceiling of tolerance. Elevated levels of ΔFosB leads to increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor ([[BDNF]]) levels, which in turn increases the number of [[dendrite|dendritic]] branches and [[dendritic spine|spines]] present on neurons involved with the nucleus accumbens and [[prefrontal cortex]] areas of the brain. This change can be identified rather quickly, and may be sustained weeks after the last dose of the drug.

===Dependence and withdrawal===
[[Cocaine dependence]] is a form of [[psychological dependence]] that develops from regular cocaine use and produces a [[drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] state with emotional-motivational deficits upon cessation of cocaine use.

===During pregnancy===
According to a 2005 review, "it is unclear whether prenatal cocaine exposure is associated with SIDS."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schiller|first1=Cassandra|last2=Allen|first2=Pat Jackson|title=Follow-up of Infants Prenatally Exposed to Cocaine|journal=Pediatric Nursing|date=September 2005|volume=31|issue=5|page=429|url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/23eb0e97c8fcec0fb1f5520caed5a73b/1?pq-origsite=gscholar|language=en}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===

The pharmacodynamics of cocaine involve the complex relationships of neurotransmitters (inhibiting [[monoamine]] uptake in rats with ratios of about: [[5HT|serotonin]]:[[dopamine]] = 2:3, serotonin:[[norepinephrine]] = 2:5).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rothman |first=Richard B. |title=Amphetamine-Type Central Nervous System Stimulants Release Norepinepehrine more Potently than they Release [[Dopamine]] and [[Serotonin]] |year=2001 |journal=Synapse |issue=1 |pages=32–41|doi=10.1002/1098-2396(20010101)39:1<32::AID-SYN5>3.0.CO;2-3|volume=39 |pmid=11071707|display-authors=etal}} (Table V. on page 37)</ref><ref name=Pom2012/> The most extensively studied effect of cocaine on the [[central nervous system]] is the blockade of the [[dopamine transporter]] protein. Dopamine [[transmitter]] released during neural signaling is normally recycled via the transporter; i.e., the transporter binds the transmitter and pumps it out of the synaptic cleft back into the [[presynaptic]] neuron, where it is taken up into storage [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]]. Cocaine binds tightly at the dopamine transporter forming a complex that blocks the transporter's function. The dopamine transporter can no longer perform its reuptake function, and thus [[dopamine]] accumulates in the [[synaptic cleft]].

Cocaine's affects certain serotonin (5-HT) receptors; in particular, it has been shown to antagonize the [[5-HT3 receptor]], which is a [[ligand-gated ion channel]]. The overabundance of 5-HT3 receptors in cocaine conditioned rats display this trait, however the exact effect of 5-HT3 in this process is unclear.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Carta M, Allan AM, Partridge LD, Valenzuela CF |title=Cocaine inhibits 5-HT3 receptor function in neurons from transgenic mice overexpressing the receptor |journal=Eur.

Cocaine has been demonstrated to bind as to directly stabilize the DAT transporter on the open outward-facing conformation. Further, cocaine binds in such a way as to inhibit a hydrogen bond innate to DAT. Cocaine's binding properties are such that it attaches so this hydrogen bond will not form and is blocked from formation due to the tightly locked orientation of the cocaine molecule. Research studies have suggested that the affinity for the transporter is not what is involved in habituation of the substance so much as the conformation and binding properties to where and how on the transporter the molecule binds.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Beuming |first=Thijs|doi=10.1038/nn.2146|title=The binding sites for cocaine and dopamine in the dopamine transporter overlap|journal=Nature Neuroscience|volume=11|year=2008|pmid=18568020|issue=7|pmc=2692229|pages=780–9|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Cocaine can often cause reduced food intake, many chronic users lose their appetite and can experience severe malnutrition and significant weight loss. Cocaine effects, further, are shown to be potentiated for the user when used in conjunction with new surroundings and stimuli, and otherwise novel environs.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Carey RJ, Damianopoulos EN, Shanahan AB |title=Cocaine effects on behavioral responding to a novel object placed in a familiar environment |journal=Pharmacol.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Cocaine has a short half life of 0.7-1.5 hours and is extensively [[metabolism|metabolized]] by [[cholinesterase]] enzymes (primarily in the [[liver]] and [[Blood plasma|plasma]]), with only about 1% excreted unchanged in the urine.<ref name="Zimmerman2012"/>  The metabolism is dominated by [[hydrolysis|hydrolytic]] [[ester]] cleavage, so the eliminated metabolites consist mostly of [[benzoylecgonine]] (BE), the major [[metabolite]], and other significant metabolites in lesser amounts such as ecgonine methyl ester (EME) and [[ecgonine]].<ref name="Zimmerman2012"/> Further minor metabolites of cocaine include [[norcocaine]], p-hydroxycocaine, m-hydroxycocaine, p-hydroxybenzoylecgonine (pOHBE), and m-hydroxybenzoylecgonine.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kolbrich EA, Barnes AJ, Gorelick DA, Boyd SJ, Cone EJ, Huestis MA |title=Major and minor metabolites of cocaine in human plasma following controlled subcutaneous cocaine administration |journal=J Anal Toxicol |volume=30 |issue=8 |pages=501–10 |year=2006 |pmid=17132243 |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&issn=0146-4760&volume=30&issue=8&spage=501&aulast=Kolbrich |doi=10.1093/jat/30.8.501 }} {{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=Level C |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> If consumed with [[ethanol|alcohol]], cocaine combines with alcohol in the [[liver]] to form [[cocaethylene]].<ref name="Zimmerman2012"/> Studies have suggested cocaethylene is both more [[Euphoria|euphoric]], and has a higher [[cardiovascular]] toxicity than cocaine by itself.<ref name="Zimmerman2012"/>

Depending on liver and kidney function, cocaine metabolites are detectable in urine. Benzoylecgonine can be detected in urine within four hours after cocaine intake and remains detectable in concentrations greater than 150&nbsp;ng/mL typically for up to eight days after cocaine is used. Detection of accumulation of cocaine metabolites in hair is possible in regular users until the sections of hair grown during use are cut or fall out.

The color of [[crack cocaine|"crack" cocaine]] depends upon several factors including the origin of the cocaine used, the method of preparation – with [[ammonia]] or [[baking soda]] – and the presence of impurities, but will generally range from white to a yellowish cream to a light brown. Its texture will also depend on the adulterants, origin and processing of the powdered cocaine, and the method of converting the base. It ranges from a crumbly texture, sometimes extremely oily, to a hard, almost crystalline nature.

===Forms===

====Salt====
Cocaine – a [[tropane alkaloid]] – is a weakly alkaline compound, and can therefore combine with acidic compounds to form various salts. The hydrochloride (HCl) salt of cocaine is by far the most commonly encountered, although the sulfate (-SO<sub>4</sub>) and the nitrate (-NO<sub>3</sub>) are occasionally seen. Different salts dissolve to a greater or lesser extent in various solvents – the hydrochloride salt is polar in character and is quite soluble in water.

====Base====
{{Main article|Freebase (chemistry)}}
As the name implies, "freebase" is the [[base (chemistry)|base]] form of cocaine, as opposed to the [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] form. It is practically insoluble in water whereas hydrochloride salt is water-soluble.

Smoking freebase cocaine has the additional effect of releasing [[methylecgonidine]] into the user's system due to the [[pyrolysis]] of the substance (a side effect which [[insufflating]] or injecting powder cocaine does not create). Some research suggests that smoking freebase cocaine can be even more cardiotoxic than other [[routes of administration]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Scheidweiler|first1=K.

Pure cocaine is prepared by neutralizing its compounding salt with an alkaline solution, which will precipitate to non-polar basic cocaine. It is further refined through aqueous-solvent [[liquid–liquid extraction]].

====Crack cocaine====
{{Main article|Crack cocaine}}

[[File:Smoking Crack.jpg|thumb|A woman smoking crack cocaine]]
[[File:Rocks of crack cocaine.jpg|thumb|right|200px|"Rocks" of crack cocaine]]
Crack is a lower purity form of free-base cocaine that is usually produced by neutralization of cocaine hydrochloride with a solution of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) and water, producing a very hard/brittle, off-white-to-brown colored, amorphous material that contains sodium carbonate, entrapped water, and other by-products as the main impurities.

The "freebase" and "crack" forms of cocaine are usually administered by vaporization of the powdered substance into smoke, which is then inhaled.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/appsych/chibps/cocaine |title=Substances – Cocaine |publisher=The Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development |accessdate=1 August 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502061752/http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/appsych/chibps/cocaine |archivedate=2 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The origin of the name "crack" comes from the "crackling" sound (and hence the [[onomatopoeic]] moniker "crack") that is produced when the cocaine and its impurities (i.e. water, sodium bicarbonate) are heated past the point of vaporization.<ref name=Nelson98>{{cite book |last=George |first=Nelson |title=Hip Hop America |year=1998 |publisher=Viking Penguin |url={{Google books |8nw6VlsqOUsC|Hip Hop America |page=40 |plainurl=yes}} |page=40 }}</ref>

Pure cocaine base/crack can be smoked because it vaporizes smoothly, with little or no decomposition at {{convert|98|°C|0|abbr=on}},<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ries |first1=Richard K. |last2=Miller |first2=Sharon C. |last3=Fiellin |first3=David A. |title=Principles of addiction medicine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j6GGBud8DXcC&pg=PT166#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=5 January 2014 |year=2009 |publisher=[[Lippincott Williams & Wilkins]] |isbn=0-7817-7477-2 |page=137 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404151454/http://books.google.com/books?id=j6GGBud8DXcC&pg=PT166#v=onepage&q&f=false |archivedate=4 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> which is below the boiling point of water.

In contrast, cocaine hydrochloride does not vaporize until heated to a much higher temperature (about 197&nbsp;°C), and considerable decomposition/burning occurs at these high temperatures. This effectively destroys some of the cocaine and yields a sharp, acrid, and foul-tasting smoke.

Smoking or vaporizing cocaine and inhaling it into the lungs produces an almost immediate "high" that can be very powerful (and addicting) quite rapidly – this initial crescendo of stimulation is known as a "rush". While the stimulating effects may last for hours, the euphoric sensation is very brief, prompting the user to smoke more immediately.

====Coca leaf infusions====
{{More citations needed|date=April 2014}}
Coca herbal [[infusion]] (also referred to as [[coca tea]]) is used in coca-leaf producing countries much as any herbal medicinal infusion would elsewhere in the world. The free and legal commercialization of dried coca leaves under the form of filtration bags to be used as "coca tea" has been actively promoted by the governments of [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]] for many years as a drink having medicinal powers. Visitors to the city of [[Cuzco]] in Peru, and [[La Paz]] in Bolivia are greeted with the offering of coca leaf infusions (prepared in teapots with whole coca leaves) purportedly to help the newly arrived traveler overcome the malaise of high altitude sickness. The effects of drinking coca tea are a mild stimulation and mood lift. It does not produce any significant numbing of the mouth nor does it give a rush like snorting cocaine. In order to prevent the demonization of this product, its promoters publicize the unproven concept that much of the effect of the ingestion of coca leaf infusion would come from the secondary alkaloids, as being not only quantitatively different from pure cocaine but also qualitatively different.

It has been promoted as an adjuvant for the treatment of cocaine dependence. In one controversial study, coca leaf infusion was used—in addition to counseling—to treat 23 addicted coca-paste smokers in [[Lima]], Peru. Relapses fell from an average of four times per month before treatment with coca tea to one during the treatment. The duration of abstinence increased from an average of 32&nbsp;days prior to treatment to 217&nbsp;days during treatment. These results suggest that the administration of coca leaf infusion plus counseling would be an effective method for preventing relapse during treatment for cocaine addiction. Importantly, these results also suggest strongly that the primary pharmacologically active metabolite in coca leaf infusions is actually cocaine and not the secondary alkaloids.{{synthesis inline|date=April 2014}}

The cocaine metabolite [[benzoylecgonine]] can be detected in the urine of people a few hours after drinking one cup of coca leaf infusion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inkanat.com/en/infohealth/mate-coca-tea.html|title=Coca tea or mate de coca – the holy coca leaf infusion|work=inkanat.com|accessdate=17 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220221155/http://www.inkanat.com/en/infohealth/mate-coca-tea.html|archivedate=20 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

====''N''-methyl-pyrrolinium cation====

The [[biosynthesis]] begins with L-[[Glutamine]], which is derived to L-[[ornithine]] in plants. The major contribution of L-ornithine and L-[[arginine]] as a precursor to the [[tropane]] ring was confirmed by Edward Leete.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Leete E, Marion L, Sspenser ID |title=Biogenesis of hyoscyamine |journal=Nature |volume=174 |issue=4431 |pages=650–1 |year=1954 |pmid=13203600 |doi=10.1038/174650a0}}</ref> Ornithine then undergoes a [[pyridoxal phosphate]]-dependent decarboxylation to form putrescine.

Hydrolysis of the imine derives ''N''-carbamoylputrescine followed with hydrolysis of the urea to form putrescine. The separate pathways of converting ornithine to putrescine in plants and animals have converged. A SAM-dependent ''N''-methylation of putrescine gives the ''N''-methylputrescine product, which then undergoes oxidative deamination by the action of diamine oxidase to yield the aminoaldehyde. Schiff base formation confirms the biosynthesis of the ''N''-methyl-Δ<sup>1</sup>-pyrrolinium cation.

====Robert Robinson's acetonedicarboxylate====
The biosynthesis of the [[tropane alkaloid]], however, is still uncertain. Hemscheidt proposes that Robinson's acetonedicarboxylate emerges as a potential intermediate for this reaction.<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1007/3-540-48146-X|title = Tropane and Related Alkaloids|year = 2000|author = T.

Decarboxylation leads to tropane alkaloid formation.

====Reduction of tropinone====
The reduction of tropinone is mediated by [[NADPH]]-dependent reductase enzymes, which have been characterized in multiple plant species.<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1016/0031-9422(92)80247-C|title = Two tropinone reducing enzymes from Datura stramonium transformed root cultures|year = 1992|author1=A.

TRI produces tropine and TRII produces pseudotropine. Due to differing kinetic and pH/activity characteristics of the enzymes and by the 25-fold higher activity of TRI over TRII, the majority of the tropinone reduction is from TRI to form tropine.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Boswell HD, Dräger B, McLauchlan WR |title=Specificities of the enzymes of ''N''-alkyltropane biosynthesis in Brugmansia and Datura |journal=Phytochemistry |volume=52 |issue=5 |pages=871–8 |year=1999|pmid=10626376 |doi=10.1016/S0031-9422(99)00293-9}}</ref>

===Detection in body fluids===
Cocaine and its major metabolites may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine to monitor for abuse, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in the forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a sudden death. Most commercial cocaine immunoassay screening tests cross-react appreciably with the major cocaine metabolites, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish and separately measure each of these substances. When interpreting the results of a test, it is important to consider the cocaine usage history of the individual, since a chronic user can develop tolerance to doses that would incapacitate a cocaine-naive individual, and the chronic user often has high baseline values of the metabolites in his system. Cautious interpretation of testing results may allow a distinction between passive or active usage, and between smoking versus other routes of administration.<ref>R.

===Europe===
Cocaine is the second most popular illegal recreational drug in Europe (behind [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]). Since the mid-1990s, overall cocaine usage in Europe has been on the rise, but usage rates and attitudes tend to vary between countries. European countries with the highest usage rates are the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, and the Republic of Ireland.

Approximately 12 million Europeans (3.6%) have used cocaine at least once, 4 million (1.2%) in the last year, and 2 million in the last month (0.5%).

About 3.5 million or 87.5% of those who have used the drug in the last year{{when|date=March 2015}} are young adults (15–34 years old). Usage is particularly prevalent among this demographic: 4% to 7% of males have used cocaine in the last year in Spain, Denmark, Republic of Ireland, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The ratio of male to female users is approximately 3.8:1, but this statistic varies from 1:1 to 13:1 depending on country.<ref name="European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction">{{cite book|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_64227_EN_EMCDDA_AR08_en.pdf|publisher=European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction|title=The State of the Drugs Problem in Europe 2008|location=Luxembourg|year=2008|format=PDF|pages=58–62|accessdate=31 December 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425191815/http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_64227_EN_EMCDDA_AR08_en.pdf|archivedate=25 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Isolation and naming===
Although the stimulant and hunger-suppressant properties of coca had been known for many centuries, the isolation of the cocaine [[alkaloid]] was not achieved until 1855. Various European scientists had attempted to isolate cocaine, but none had been successful for two reasons: the knowledge of chemistry required was insufficient at the time,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} and contemporary conditions of sea-shipping from South America could degrade the cocaine in the plant samples available to European chemists. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The cocaine alkaloid was first isolated by the German chemist [[Friedrich Gaedcke]] in 1855. Gaedcke named the alkaloid "erythroxyline", and published a description in the journal ''Archiv der Pharmazie.''<ref>{{cite journal|title = Ueber das Erythroxylin, dargestellt aus den Blättern des in Südamerika cultivirten Strauches Erythroxylon Coca|author = Gaedcke, F.|journal = Archiv der Pharmazie|volume = 132|issue = 2|pages = 141–150|year = 1855|doi = 10.1002/ardp.18551320208}}</ref>

In 1856, [[Friedrich Wöhler]] asked Dr. [[Carl Scherzer]], a scientist aboard the ''[[SMS Novara|Novara]]'' (an Austrian [[frigate]] sent by Emperor [[Franz Joseph of Austria|Franz Joseph]] to circle the globe), to bring him a large amount of coca leaves from South America. In 1859, the ship finished its travels and Wöhler received a trunk full of coca. Wöhler passed on the leaves to [[Albert Niemann (chemist)|Albert Niemann]], a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] student at the [[University of Göttingen]] in Germany, who then developed an improved purification process.<ref name=nie1860>{{cite journal|volume = 153|issue = 2|pages = 129–256|year = 1860|title = Ueber eine neue organische Base in den Cocablättern|author = Albert Niemann|doi = 10.1002/ardp.18601530202|journal = Archiv der Pharmazie}}</ref>

Niemann described every step he took to isolate cocaine in his [[dissertation]] titled ''[[On a New Organic Base in the Coca Leaves|Über eine neue organische Base in den Cocablättern]]'' (''On a New Organic Base in the Coca Leaves''), which was published in 1860—it earned him his Ph.D. and is now in the [[British Library]]. He wrote of the alkaloid's "colourless transparent prisms" and said that "Its solutions have an alkaline reaction, a bitter taste, promote the flow of saliva and leave a peculiar numbness, followed by a sense of cold when applied to the tongue." Niemann named the alkaloid "cocaine" from "coca" (from [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] "cuca") + [[affix|suffix]] "ine".<ref name=nie1860 /><ref>{{OEtymD|Cocaine}}</ref> Because of its use as a [[local anesthetic]], a suffix "-caine" was later extracted and used to form names of synthetic [[local anesthetic]]s.

With the discovery of this new alkaloid, Western medicine was quick to exploit the possible uses of this plant.

In 1879, Vassili von Anrep, of the [[University of Würzburg]], devised an experiment to demonstrate the analgesic properties of the newly discovered alkaloid. He prepared two separate jars, one containing a cocaine-salt solution, with the other containing merely salt water. He then submerged a frog's legs into the two jars, one leg in the treatment and one in the control solution, and proceeded to stimulate the legs in several different ways. The leg that had been immersed in the cocaine solution reacted very differently from the leg that had been immersed in salt water.<ref name="anrep_frog">{{cite journal |vauthors=Yentis SM, Vlassakov KV |title=Vassily von Anrep, forgotten pioneer of regional anesthesia |journal=Anesthesiology |volume=90 |issue=3 |pages=890–5 |year=1999|pmid=10078692 |doi=10.1097/00000542-199903000-00033}}</ref>

[[Karl Koller (ophthalmologist)|Karl Koller]] (a close associate of [[Sigmund Freud]], who would write about cocaine later) experimented with cocaine for [[ophthalmology|ophthalmic]] usage. In an infamous experiment in 1884, he experimented upon himself by applying a cocaine solution to his own eye and then pricking it with pins. His findings were presented to the Heidelberg Ophthalmological Society. Also in 1884, Jellinek demonstrated the effects of cocaine as a [[respiratory system]] anesthetic. In 1885, [[William Halsted]] demonstrated nerve-block anesthesia,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Practical comments on the use and abuse of cocaine|author=Halsted W|journal=New York Medical Journal|year=1885|pages=294–295|volume=42}}</ref> and [[James Leonard Corning]] demonstrated [[peridural]] anesthesia.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Corning JL|year=1885|journal=New York Medical Journal|title=An experimental study|volume=42|page=483}}</ref> 1898 saw [[Heinrich Quincke]] use cocaine for [[spinal anesthesia]].

In 1859, an Italian [[physician|doctor]], [[Paolo Mantegazza]], returned from [[Peru]], where he had witnessed first-hand the use of coca by the local indigenous peoples. He proceeded to experiment on himself and upon his return to [[Milan]] he wrote a paper in which he described the effects. In this paper he declared coca and cocaine (at the time they were assumed to be the same) as being useful medicinally, in the treatment of "a furred tongue in the morning, [[flatulence]], and whitening of the teeth."

A chemist named [[Angelo Mariani (chemist)|Angelo Mariani]] who read Mantegazza's paper became immediately intrigued with coca and its economic potential. In 1863, Mariani started marketing a [[wine]] called [[Vin Mariani]], which had been treated with coca leaves, to become [[cocawine]]. The [[ethanol]] in wine acted as a solvent and extracted the cocaine from the coca leaves, altering the drink's effect. It contained 6&nbsp;mg cocaine per ounce of wine, but Vin Mariani which was to be exported contained 7.2&nbsp;mg per ounce, to compete with the higher cocaine content of similar drinks in the United States. A "pinch of coca leaves" was included in [[John Pemberton|John Styth Pemberton]]'s original 1886 recipe for [[Coca-Cola]], though the company began using decocainized leaves in 1906 when the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] was passed.

In 1879 cocaine began to be used to treat [[morphine]] addiction. Cocaine was introduced into clinical use as a [[local anesthetic]] in Germany in 1884, about the same time as [[Sigmund Freud]] published his work ''Über Coca'', in which he wrote that cocaine causes:<ref>{{cite web|title=How a Young Sigmund Freud Researched & Got Addicted to Cocaine, the New “Miracle Drug,” in 1894|url=http://www.openculture.com/2014/04/igmund-freud-researched-got-addicted-to-cocaine.html|website=Open Culture|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307204530/http://www.openculture.com/2014/04/igmund-freud-researched-got-addicted-to-cocaine.html|archivedate=7 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In 1885 the U.S. manufacturer [[Parke-Davis]] sold cocaine in various forms, including cigarettes, powder, and even a cocaine mixture that could be injected directly into the user's veins with the included needle. The company promised that its cocaine products would "supply the place of food, make the coward brave, the silent eloquent and render the sufferer insensitive to pain."

By the late [[Victorian era]], cocaine use had appeared as a vice in [[literature]]. For example, it was injected by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s fictional [[Sherlock Holmes]], generally to offset the boredom he felt when he was not working on a case.

In early 20th-century [[Memphis, Tennessee]], cocaine was sold in neighborhood drugstores on [[Beale Street]], costing five or ten cents for a small boxful. Stevedores along the Mississippi River used the drug as a stimulant, and white employers encouraged its use by black laborers.<ref name= barlow>Barlow, William.

In 1995 the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute]] (UNICRI) announced in a press release the publication of the results of the largest global study on cocaine use ever undertaken. However, a decision by an American representative in the [[World Health Assembly]] banned the publication of the study, because it seemed to make a case for the positive uses of cocaine. An excerpt of the report strongly conflicted
with accepted paradigms, for example "that occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems." In the sixth meeting of the B committee, the US representative threatened that "If World Health Organization activities relating to drugs failed to reinforce proven drug control approaches, funds for the relevant programs should be curtailed". This led to the decision to discontinue publication.

A problem with illegal cocaine use, especially in the higher volumes used to combat fatigue (rather than increase euphoria) by long-term users, is the risk of ill effects or damage caused by the compounds used in adulteration. Cutting or "stepping on" the drug is commonplace, using compounds which simulate ingestion effects, such as [[Novocain]] (procaine) producing temporary anesthaesia, as many users believe a strong numbing effect is the result of strong and/or pure cocaine, ephedrine or similar stimulants that are to produce an increased heart rate. The normal adulterants for profit are inactive sugars, usually mannitol, creatine or glucose, so introducing active adulterants gives the illusion of purity and to 'stretch' or make it so a dealer can sell more product than without the adulterants.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The adulterant of sugars allows the dealer to sell the product for a higher price because of the illusion of purity and allows sale of more of the product at that higher price, enabling dealers to significantly increase revenue with little additional cost for the adulterants. A 2007 study by the [[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]] showed that the purity levels for street purchased cocaine was often under 5% and on average under 50% pure.<ref>{{cite web|title=EMCDDA Retail Cocaine Purity Study|year=2007|author=EMCDDA|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/stats09/ppptab7a|accessdate=31 December 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101041854/http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/stats09/ppptab7a|archivedate=1 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The production, distribution, and sale of cocaine products is restricted (and illegal in most contexts) in most countries as regulated by the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]], and the [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]]. In the United States the manufacture, importation, possession, and distribution of cocaine are additionally regulated by the 1970 [[Controlled Substances Act]].

===Economics===
Because of the drug's potential for addiction and overdose, cocaine is generally treated as a "[[hard and soft drugs|hard drug]]", with severe penalties for possession and trafficking. Demand remains high, and consequently, black market cocaine is quite expensive. Unprocessed cocaine, such as [[coca leaves]], are occasionally purchased and sold, but this is exceedingly rare as it is much easier and more profitable to conceal and smuggle it in powdered form. The scale of the market is immense: 770 [[tonne]]s times $100 per gram retail = up to $77 billion.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

====Production====
Until 2012, Colombia was the world's leading producer of cocaine.<ref name="CIA World Factbook">[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/co.html Colombia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513074502/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/co.html |date=13 May 2009 }}. CIA World Factbook</ref><ref name="NBC Worldnews">[http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/07/31/13045253-us-peru-overtakes-colombia-as-top-cocaine-producer?lite Peru Overtakes Colombia as Top Cocaine Producer]. NBC News (31 July 2012)  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304055344/http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/07/31/13045253-us-peru-overtakes-colombia-as-top-cocaine-producer?lite |date=4 March 2016 }}</ref> Three-quarters of the world's annual yield of cocaine has been produced in Colombia, both from cocaine base imported from Peru (primarily the [[Huallaga Valley]]) and Bolivia, and from locally grown coca. There was a 28% increase from the amount of potentially harvestable coca plants which were grown in Colombia in 1998. This, combined with crop reductions in Bolivia and Peru, made Colombia the nation with the largest area of [[cocaine production in Colombia|coca under cultivation]] after the mid-1990s. Coca is grown for traditional purposes by indigenous communities, a use which is still present and is permitted by Colombian laws only makes up a small fragment of total coca production, most of which is used for the illegal drug trade.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

An interview with a coca farmer published in 2003 described a mode of production by [[acid-base extraction]] that has changed little since 1905. Roughly {{convert|625|lb|kg}} of leaves were harvested per [[hectare]], six times per year. The leaves were dried for half a day, then chopped into small pieces with a string trimmer and sprinkled with a small amount of powdered cement (replacing [[sodium carbonate]] from former times). Several hundred pounds of this mixture were soaked in {{convert|50|USgal|L}} of gasoline for a day, then the gasoline was removed and the leaves were pressed for remaining liquid, after which they could be discarded. Then [[battery acid]] (weak [[sulfuric acid]]) was used, one bucket per {{convert|25|kg|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} of leaves, to create a [[phase (matter)|phase]] separation in which the cocaine [[free base]] in the gasoline was acidified and extracted into a few buckets of "murky-looking smelly liquid". Once powdered [[caustic soda]] was added to this, the cocaine precipitated and could be removed by filtration through a cloth. The resulting material, when dried, was termed ''[[cocaine paste|pasta]]'' and sold by the farmer. The 3750&nbsp;pound yearly harvest of leaves from a hectare produced {{convert|2.5|kg|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} of ''pasta''<!--- note that this figure is only about ⅓ of the figure inferred from the numbers below --->, approximately 40–60% cocaine. Repeated recrystallization from solvents, producing ''pasta lavada'' and eventually crystalline cocaine were performed at specialized laboratories after the sale.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ceLzaeHsZAC&pg=PA462|title=Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography|author=Streatfeild, Dominic|publisher=Macmillan|year=2003|isbn=978-0-312-42226-4|accessdate=5 January 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115082648/http://books.google.com/books?id=9ceLzaeHsZAC&pg=PA462|archivedate=15 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Attempts to eradicate coca fields through the use of [[defoliants]] have devastated part of the farming economy in some coca growing regions of Colombia, and strains appear to have been developed that are more resistant or immune to their use. Whether these strains are natural mutations or the product of human tampering is unclear. These strains have also shown to be more potent than those previously grown, increasing profits for the drug cartels responsible for the exporting of cocaine. Although production fell temporarily, coca crops rebounded in numerous smaller fields in Colombia, rather than the larger plantations.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The cultivation of coca has become an attractive economic decision for many growers due to the combination of several factors, including the lack of other employment alternatives, the lower profitability of alternative crops in official crop substitution programs, the eradication-related damages to non-drug farms, the spread of new strains of the coca plant due to persistent worldwide demand.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The latest estimate provided by the U.S. authorities on the annual production of cocaine in Colombia refers to 290 metric tons.
As of the end of 2011, the seizure operations of [[Colombian cocaine]] carried out in different countries have totaled 351.8 metric tons of cocaine, i.e. 121.3% of Colombia's annual production according to the U.S. Department of State's estimates.

====Synthesis====
Synthetic cocaine would be highly desirable to the illegal drug industry as it would eliminate the high visibility and low reliability of offshore sources and international smuggling, replacing them with clandestine domestic laboratories, as are common for illicit [[methamphetamine]]. However, natural cocaine remains the lowest cost and highest quality supply of cocaine. Actual full synthesis of cocaine is rarely done. Formation of inactive [[enantiomers]] (cocaine has 4 chiral centres – ''1R'', ''2R'', ''3S'', and ''5S'' – hence a total potential of 16 possible enantiomers and [[diastereoisomers]]) plus synthetic by-products limits the yield and purity.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
Names like "synthetic cocaine" and "new cocaine" have been misapplied to [[phencyclidine]] (PCP) and various [[designer drug]]s.<ref>{{cite book|title=Pharmacology for Anesthetists|publisher=PediaPress|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Du2bfrO9FwC&pg=PA50|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910234911/https://books.google.com/books?id=_Du2bfrO9FwC&pg=PA50|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

====Trafficking and distribution====
[[File:CocaineUkelele-Opened.jpg|thumb|Cocaine smuggled in a [[charango]], 2008]]
[[Organized crime|Organized criminal]] gangs operating on a large scale dominate the cocaine trade. Most cocaine is grown and processed in South America, particularly in Colombia, [[Bolivia]], Peru, and smuggled into the United States and Europe, the United States being the world's largest consumer of cocaine,<ref name="WFK Illicit drugs">{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2086.html |title=Field Listing – Illicit drugs (by country) |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=15 January 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229044611/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2086.html |archivedate=29 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> where it is sold at huge markups; usually in the US at $80–120 for 1&nbsp;gram, and $250–300 for 3.5&nbsp;grams (⅛ of an ounce, or an "eight ball").<ref>{{cite web|title=How Much Is a Gram of Coke?|url=http://www.newhealthadvisor.com/How-Much-Is-a-Gram-of-Coke.html|website=New Health Advisor|date=3 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307123722/http://www.newhealthadvisor.com/How-Much-Is-a-Gram-of-Coke.html|archivedate=7 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=====Caribbean and Mexican routes=====
{{as of| 2005}}, cocaine shipments from South America transported through [[Mexico]] or [[Central America]] were generally moved over land or by air to staging sites in northern Mexico. The cocaine is then broken down into smaller loads for smuggling across the [[US-Mexico border|U.S.–Mexico border]]. The primary cocaine importation points in the United States have been in [[Arizona]], southern [[California]], southern [[Florida]], and [[Texas]]. Typically, land vehicles are driven across the U.S.–Mexico border. Sixty-five percent of cocaine enters the United States through Mexico, and the vast majority of the rest enters through Florida.<ref>Jacobson, Robert (2005). ''Illegal Drugs: America's Anguish''. Farmington Hills, Michigan: Thomson Gale. {{ISBN|1-4144-0419-0}}.</ref>{{page needed|date=December 2015}} {{As of|2015}}, the [[Sinaloa Cartel]] is the most active [[drug cartel]] involved in smuggling illicit drugs like cocaine into the United States and trafficking them throughout the United States.<ref name="DEA 2015 assessment">{{cite web|title=2015 National Drug Threat Assessment Summary|url=http://www.dea.gov/docs/2015%20NDTA%20Report.pdf|website=Drug Enforcement Administration|publisher=United States Department of Justice: Drug Enforcement Administration|accessdate=10 April 2016|pages=1–2|date=October 2015|quote=Mexican TCOs pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them.

Cocaine traffickers from Colombia and Mexico have established a labyrinth of [[smuggling]] routes throughout the Caribbean, the Bahama Island chain, and South Florida. They often hire traffickers from Mexico or the [[Dominican Republic]] to transport the drug using a variety of smuggling techniques to U.S. markets. These include airdrops of {{convert|500|to|700|kg|-2|abbr=on}} in the [[Bahama Islands]] or off the coast of [[Puerto Rico]], mid-ocean boat-to-boat transfers of {{convert|500|to|2000|kg|-2|abbr=on}}, and the commercial shipment of tonnes of cocaine through the port of [[Miami]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

=====Chilean route=====
Another route of cocaine traffic goes through Chile, which is primarily used for cocaine produced in Bolivia since the nearest seaports lie in northern Chile. The arid Bolivia–Chile border is easily crossed by 4×4 vehicles that then head to the seaports of [[Iquique]] and [[Antofagasta]]. While the price of cocaine is higher in Chile than in Peru and Bolivia, the final destination is usually Europe, especially Spain where drug dealing networks exist among South American immigrants.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

=====Techniques=====
Cocaine is also carried in small, concealed, kilogram quantities across the border by couriers known as "[[mule (smuggling)|mules]]" (or "mulas"), who cross a border either legally, for example, through a port or airport, or illegally elsewhere. The drugs may be strapped to the waist or legs or hidden in bags, or hidden in the body. If the mule gets through without being caught, the gangs will reap most of the profits. If he or she is caught, however, gangs will sever all links and the mule will usually stand trial for trafficking alone.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Bulk cargo ships are also used to smuggle cocaine to staging sites in the western Caribbean–[[Gulf of Mexico]] area. These vessels are typically 150–250-foot (50–80&nbsp;m) coastal freighters that carry an average cocaine load of approximately 2.5 tonnes. Commercial fishing vessels are also used for smuggling operations. In areas with a high volume of recreational traffic, smugglers use the same types of vessels, such as [[go-fast boat]]s, as those used by the local populations.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Sophisticated [[narco-submarine|drug subs]] are the latest tool drug runners are using to bring cocaine north from Colombia, it was reported on 20 March 2008. Although the vessels were once viewed as a quirky sideshow in the drug war, they are becoming faster, more seaworthy, and capable of carrying bigger loads of drugs than earlier models, according to those charged with catching them.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/03/20/drug.subs/index.html|title=Coast Guard hunts drug-running semi-subs|accessdate=20 March 2008|publisher=CNN|date=20 March 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321111250/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/03/20/drug.subs/index.html|archivedate=21 March 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

====Sales to consumers====
[[File:Flavcocaine.jpg|thumb|Cocaine adulterated with fruit flavoring]]

Cocaine is readily available in all major countries' metropolitan areas. According to the ''Summer 1998 Pulse Check'', published by the U.S. [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]], cocaine use had stabilized across the country, with a few increases reported in [[San Diego]], [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], Miami, and [[Boston]]. In the West, cocaine usage was lower, which was thought to be due to a switch to [[methamphetamine]] among some users; methamphetamine is cheaper, three and a half times more powerful, and lasts 12–24&nbsp;times longer with each dose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://methproject.org/Meth_Info/education.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327140334/http://methproject.org/Meth_Info/education.php |archivedate=27 March 2010|title=Meth Info |publisher=Methproject.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denisonia.com/policeDept/amphetamines.asp|title=Drugs of Abuse|work=City of Denison Iowa|accessdate=13 November 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106092215/http://www.denisonia.com/policeDept/amphetamines.asp|archivedate=6 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Nevertheless, the number of cocaine users remain high, with a large concentration among urban youth.

In addition to the amounts previously mentioned, cocaine can be sold in "bill sizes": {{As of|2007}} for example, $10 might purchase a "dime bag", a very small amount (0.1–0.15&nbsp;g) of cocaine. Twenty dollars might purchase 0.15–0.3&nbsp;g. However, in lower Texas, it is sold cheaper due to it being easier to receive: a dime for $10 is 0.4 g, a 20 is 0.8–1.0&nbsp;g and an 8-ball (3.5 g) is sold for $60 to $80, depending on the quality and dealer.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} These amounts and prices are very popular among young people because they are inexpensive and easily concealed on one's body. Quality and price can vary dramatically depending on supply and demand, and on geographic region.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/9414607 |title=Drugs: Pricing Power |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=28 June 2007 |quote=Prices: USA around $110/g, Israel/Germany/Britain around $46/g, Colombia $2/g, New Zealand recordbreaking $714.30/g. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106040602/http://www.economist.com/node/9414607 |archivedate=6 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><!--OLD URL:http://www.economist.com/daily/chartgallery/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9414607-->

====Consumption====
World annual cocaine consumption, as of 2000, stood at around 600 tonnes, with the United States consuming around 300 t, 50% of the total, Europe about 150 t, 25% of the total, and the rest of the world the remaining 150 t or 25%.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/policy/sections/policy_offices/solic/cn/cocaine2.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911061809/http://www.defenselink.mil/policy/sections/policy_offices/solic/cn/cocaine2.pdf|archivedate=11 September 2008|title=The Cocaine Threat: A Hemispheric Perspective|publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]]|format=PDF}}</ref> It is estimated that 1.5 million people in the United States used cocaine in 2010 down from 2.4 million in 2006.<ref name="Zimmerman2012"/> Conversely, cocaine use appears to be increasing in Europe with the highest prevalences in [[Spain]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Italy]], and [[Ireland]].<ref name="Zimmerman2012">{{cite journal|last1=Zimmerman|first1=JL|title=Cocaine intoxication|journal=Critical Care Clinics|date=October 2012|volume=28|issue=4|pages=517–26|doi=10.1016/j.ccc.2012.07.003|pmid=22998988}}</ref>

The 2010 UN [[World Drug Report]] concluded that "it appears that the North American cocaine market has declined in value from US$47 billion in 1998 to US$38 billion in 2008.

'''Phosphorus''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''P''' and [[atomic number]] 15. As an element, phosphorus exists in two major forms, [[white phosphorus]] and [[red phosphorus]], but because it is highly [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]], phosphorus is never found as a free element on Earth. With a concentration of 0.099%, phosphorus is the most abundant [[pnictogen]] in the Earth's crust. Other than a few exceptions, minerals containing phosphorus are in the maximally [[redox|oxidized]] state as inorganic [[phosphate minerals|phosphate rocks]].

The first form of elemental phosphorus that was produced (white phosphorus, in 1669) emits a faint glow when exposed to [[oxygen]] – hence the name, taken from Greek mythology, {{lang|el|Φωσφόρος}} meaning "light-bearer" (Latin ''[[Lucifer]]''), referring to the "[[Phosphorus (morning star)|Morning Star]]", the planet [[Venus]] (or [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]). The term "[[phosphorescence]]", meaning glow after illumination, originally derives from this property of phosphorus, although this word has since been used for a different physical process that produces a glow. The glow of phosphorus itself originates from [[oxidation]] of the white (but not red) phosphorus — a process now termed [[chemiluminescence]].  Together with nitrogen, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth, phosphorus is classified as a [[pnictogen]].

Phosphorus is essential for life. [[Phosphate]]s (compounds containing the phosphate ion, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup>) are a component of [[DNA]], [[RNA]], [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], and [[phospholipid]]s. Elemental phosphorus was first isolated from human [[urine]], and [[bone ash]] was an important early phosphate source. [[Phosphate]] mines contain fossils because phosphate is present in the fossilized deposits of animal remains and excreta. Low phosphate levels are an important limit to growth in some aquatic systems. The vast majority of phosphorus compounds produced are consumed as [[fertiliser]]s. Phosphate is needed to replace the phosphorus that plants remove from the soil, and its annual demand is rising nearly twice as fast as the growth of the human population. Other applications include [[organophosphorus compound]]s in [[detergent]]s, [[pesticide]]s, and [[nerve agent]]s.

Phosphorus has several [[allotropy|allotropes]] that exhibit strikingly different properties.<ref name=HW85>{{Cite book|author=A. Holleman|author2=N.

From the perspective of applications and chemical literature, the most important form of elemental phosphorus is [[Allotropes of phosphorus#White phosphorus|white phosphorus]], often abbreviated as '''WP'''. It is a soft and waxy solid which consists of tetrahedral {{chem|P|4}} molecules, in which each atom is bound to the other three atoms by a single bond. This {{chem|P|4}} tetrahedron is also present in liquid and gaseous phosphorus up to the temperature of {{convert|800|C|F}} when it starts decomposing to {{chem|P|2}} molecules.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/cber.19971300911|title=On the Polymorphism of White Phosphorus|date=1997|author=Simon, Arndt|journal=Chemische Berichte|volume=130|page=1235|last2=Borrmann|first2=Horst|last3=Horakh|first3=Jörg|issue=9}}</ref> White phosphorus exists in two crystalline forms: α (alpha) and β (beta). At room temperature, the α-form is stable, which is more common and it has cubic crystal structure and at {{convert|195.2|K|C}}, it transforms into β-form, which has hexagonal crystal structure. These forms differ in terms of the relative orientations of the constituent P<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra.<ref>{{cite book|title=Drinking Water Health Advisory: Munitions|author=Welford C.

Hartley|publisher=CRC Press, 1992|edition=illustrated|isbn=0873717546|page=399}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Topics in Phosphate Chemistry|author=Marie-Thérèse Averbuch-Pouchot|author2=A.

White phosphorus is the least stable, the most reactive, the most [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]], the least [[density|dense]], and the most toxic of the allotropes. White phosphorus gradually changes to red phosphorus. This transformation is accelerated by light and heat, and samples of white phosphorus almost always contain some red phosphorus and accordingly appear yellow. For this reason, white phosphorus that is aged or otherwise impure (e.g., weapons-grade, not lab-grade WP) is also called '''yellow phosphorus'''. When exposed to oxygen, white phosphorus glows in the dark with a very faint tinge of green and blue.  It is highly [[flammable]] and [[pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]] (self-igniting) upon contact with air.  Owing to its pyrophoricity, white phosphorus is used as an additive in [[napalm]]. The odour of combustion of this form has a characteristic garlic smell, and samples are commonly coated with white "[[phosphorus pentoxide]]", which consists of {{chem|P|4|O|10}} tetrahedra with oxygen inserted between the phosphorus atoms and at their vertices. White phosphorus is insoluble in water but soluble in carbon disulfide.<ref name=Greenwood/>

[[Thermal decomposition|Thermolysis]] of P<sub>4</sub> at 1100&nbsp;kelvin gives [[diphosphorus]], P<sub>2</sub>. This species is not stable as a solid or liquid. The dimeric unit contains a triple bond and is analogous to N<sub>2</sub>. It can also be generated as a transient intermediate in solution by thermolysis of organophosphorus precursor reagents.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume = 313|issue = 5791|doi = 10.1126/science.1129630|title = Triple-Bond Reactivity of Diphosphorus Molecules|date = 2006|author = Piro, N.

[[Red phosphorus]] is polymeric in structure. It can be viewed as a derivative of P<sub>4</sub> wherein one P-P bond is broken, and one additional bond is formed with the neighbouring tetrahedron resulting in a chain-like structure. Red phosphorus may be formed by heating white phosphorus to {{convert|250|C|F}} or by exposing white phosphorus to sunlight.<ref name="mellor-717">{{harvnb|Parkes|Mellor|1939|page=717}}</ref> Phosphorus after this treatment is [[amorphous]]. Upon further heating, this material crystallises. In this sense, red phosphorus is not an allotrope, but rather an intermediate phase between the white and violet phosphorus, and most of its properties have a range of values.

[[Violet phosphorus]] is a form of phosphorus that can be produced by day-long annealing of red phosphorus above 550&nbsp;°C. In 1865, [[Hittorf]] discovered that when phosphorus was recrystallised from molten [[lead]], a red/purple form is obtained. Therefore, this form is sometimes known as "Hittorf's phosphorus" (or violet or α-metallic phosphorus).<ref name=berger/>

[[Black phosphorus]] is the least reactive allotrope and the thermodynamically stable form below {{convert|550|C}}. It is also known as β-metallic phosphorus and has a structure somewhat resembling that of [[graphite]].<ref name="Brown">{{Cite journal|author = A. Brown|author2 = S.

===Chemiluminescence===
It was known from early times that the green glow emanating from white phosphorus would persist for a time in a stoppered jar, but then cease. [[Robert Boyle]] in the 1680s ascribed it to "debilitation" of the air; in fact, it is oxygen being consumed. By the 18th century, it was known that in pure oxygen, phosphorus does not glow at all;<ref>{{cite web|url = http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/1956/press.html|title = Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1956 – Presentation Speech by Professor A. Ölander (committee member)| accessdate = 2009-05-05}}</ref> there is only a range of [[partial pressure]]s at which it does. Heat can be applied to drive the reaction at higher pressures.<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.lateralscience.co.uk/phos/index.html|title = Phosphorus Topics page, at Lateral Science| accessdate = 2009-05-05}}</ref>

In 1974, the glow was explained by R. J. van Zee and A. U. Khan.<ref name="shockinghistory">{{Cite book| last= Emsley|first= John|date = 2000|title = The Shocking History of Phosphorus |location= London|publisher = Macmillan| isbn = 0-330-39005-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/j100561a021|title=The phosphorescence of phosphorus|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry|volume=80|issue=20|pages=2240|year=1976|last1=Vanzee|first1=Richard J.|last2=Khan|first2=Ahsan U.}}</ref> A reaction with oxygen takes place at the surface of the solid (or liquid) phosphorus, forming the short-lived molecules HPO and {{chem|P|2|O|2}} that both emit visible light. The reaction is slow and only very little of the intermediates are required to produce the luminescence, hence the extended time the glow continues in a stoppered jar.

Since that time, ''[[phosphor]]s'' and ''[[phosphorescence]]'' were used loosely to describe substances that shine in the dark without burning. Although the term [[phosphorescence]] is derived from phosphorus, the reaction that gives phosphorus its glow is properly called [[chemiluminescence]] (glowing due to a cold chemical reaction), not phosphorescence (re-emitting light that previously fell onto a substance and excited it).<ref name=sommers>{{cite book|title=Phosphorus|author=Michael A. Sommers|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group, 2007|isbn=1404219609|page=25}}</ref>

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of phosphorus}}
Twenty-three [[isotopes]] of phosphorus are known,<ref>{{cite web| title = The Berkeley Laboratory Isotopes Project|url = http://ie.lbl.gov/education/parent/P_iso.htm| accessdate = 2009-05-05}}</ref> including all possibilities from {{chem|24|P}} up to {{chem|46|P}}. Only {{chem|31|P}} is stable and is therefore present at 100% abundance. The half-integer [[nuclear spin]] and high abundance of <sup>31</sup>P make [[phosphorus-31 NMR]] spectroscopy a very useful analytical tool in studies of phosphorus-containing samples.

Two [[radioactive isotope]]s of phosphorus have half-lives suitable for biological scientific experiments. These are:
* {{chem|32|P}}, a [[beta particle|beta]]-emitter (1.71&nbsp;MeV) with a [[half-life]] of 14.3 days, which is used routinely in life-science laboratories, primarily to produce [[radiolabel]]ed DNA and RNA [[Hybridization probe|probes]], ''e.g.'' for use in [[Northern blot]]s or [[Southern blot]]s. 
* {{chem|33|P}}, a beta-emitter (0.25&nbsp;MeV) with a half-life of 25.4 days. It is used in life-science laboratories in applications in which lower energy beta emissions are advantageous such as [[DNA]] sequencing.
The high energy beta particles from {{chem|32|P}} penetrate skin and [[cornea]]s and any {{chem|32|P}} ingested, inhaled, or absorbed is readily incorporated into bone and [[nucleic acid]]s.  For these reasons, [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] in the United States, and similar institutions in other developed countries require personnel working with {{chem|32|P}} to wear lab coats, disposable gloves, and safety glasses or goggles to protect the eyes, and avoid working directly over open containers.  [[Biomonitoring|Monitoring]] personal, clothing, and surface contamination is also required.  [[Radiation protection|Shielding]] requires special consideration.  The high energy of the beta particles gives rise to secondary emission of [[X-ray]]s via [[Bremsstrahlung]] (braking radiation) in dense shielding materials such as lead.  Therefore, the radiation must be shielded with low density materials such as acrylic or other plastic, water, or (when transparency is not required), even wood.<ref>{{cite web |title=Phosphorus-32 |url=http://www.oseh.umich.edu/pdf/TrainP32.pdf |publisher=University of Michigan Department of Occupational Safety & Environmental Health |accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref>

===Universe===
In 2013, astronomers detected phosphorus in [[Cassiopeia A]], which confirmed that this element is produced in [[supernova]]e as a byproduct of [[supernova nucleosynthesis]]. The phosphorus-to-[[iron]] ratio in material from the [[supernova remnant]] could be up to 100 times higher than in the [[Milky Way]] in general.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Koo | first1 = B.-C. | last2 = Lee | first2 = Y.-H. | last3 = Moon | first3 = D.-S. | last4 = Yoon | first4 = S.-C. | last5 = Raymond | first5 = J.

===Crust and organic sources===
At 0.099%, phosphorus is the most abundant [[pnictogen]] in the Earth's crust but it is not found free in nature; it is widely distributed in many [[mineral]]s, mainly phosphates.<ref name="Abundance"/> Inorganic [[phosphate rock]], which is partially made of [[apatite]] (a group of minerals being, generally, pentacalcium triorthophosphate fluoride (hydroxide)), is today the chief commercial source of this element. According to the [[US Geological Survey|US Geological Survey (USGS)]], about 50 percent of the global phosphorus reserves are in the Arab nations.<ref name="USGS">{{cite web| accessdate = 2009-06-06| publisher = USGS| url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/phosphate_rock/|title = Phosphate Rock: Statistics and Information}}</ref> Large deposits of apatite are located in [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Russia]], [[Morocco]],<ref name="MJ" /> [[Florida]], [[Idaho]],  [[Tennessee]], [[Utah]], and elsewhere.<ref>Klein, Cornelis and Cornelius S. Hurlbut, Jr., ''Manual of Mineralogy'', Wiley, 1985, 20th ed., p. 360, {{ISBN|0-471-80580-7}}</ref> [[Albright and Wilson]] in the UK and their [[Niagara Falls]] plant, for instance, were using phosphate rock in the 1890s and 1900s from Tennessee, Florida, and the [[Îles du Connétable]] ([[guano]] island sources of phosphate); by 1950, they were using phosphate rock mainly from Tennessee and North Africa.<ref name="threlfall-51">{{harvnb|Threlfall|1951|page=51}}</ref> 

Organic sources, namely [[urine]], [[bone ash]] and (in the latter 19th century) [[guano]], were historically of importance but had only limited commercial success.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Chemistry of Phosphorus|author=Arthur D. F. Toy|publisher=Elsevier, 2013|isbn=148314741X|page=389}}</ref> As urine contains phosphorus, it has fertilising qualities which are still harnessed today in some countries, including [[Sweden]], using methods for [[reuse of excreta]].

===Phosphorus(V)===
[[File:Phosphorus-pentoxide-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|The tetrahedral structure of P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub> and P<sub>4</sub>S<sub>10</sub>.]]
The most prevalent compounds of phosphorus are derivatives of phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup>), a tetrahedral anion.<ref>D. E. C. Corbridge "Phosphorus: An Outline of its Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Technology" 5th Edition Elsevier: Amsterdam 1995. {{ISBN|0-444-89307-5}}.</ref> Phosphate is the conjugate base of phosphoric acid, which is produced on a massive scale for use in fertilisers. Being triprotic, phosphoric acid converts stepwise to three conjugate bases:
:H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ''K''<sub>a1</sub>= 7.25×10<sup>−3</sup>

:H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ''K''<sub>a2</sub>= 6.31×10<sup>−8</sup>

:HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + &nbsp;PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ''K''<sub>a3</sub>= 3.98×10<sup>−13</sup>

Phosphate exhibits the tendency to form chains and rings with P-O-P bonds. Many polyphosphates are known, including [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. Polyphosphates arise by dehydration of hydrogen phosphates such as HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup>. For example, the industrially important trisodium triphosphate (also known as [[sodium tripolyphosphate]], STPP) is produced industrially on by the megatonne by this [[condensation reaction]]:
: 2 Na<sub>2</sub>[(HO)PO<sub>3</sub>] + Na[(HO)<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub>] → Na<sub>5</sub>[O<sub>3</sub>P-O-P(O)<sub>2</sub>-O-PO<sub>3</sub>] + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O
[[Phosphorus pentoxide]] (P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>) is the [[acid anhydride]] of phosphoric acid, but several intermediates between the two are known. This waxy white solid reacts vigorously with water.

With metal [[cation]]s, phosphate forms a variety of salts. These solids are polymeric, featuring P-O-M linkages. When the metal cation has a charge of 2+ or 3+, the salts are generally insoluble, hence they exist as common minerals. Many phosphate salts are derived from hydrogen phosphate (HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>).

[[phosphorus pentachloride|PCl<sub>5</sub>]] and [[phosphorus pentafluoride|PF<sub>5</sub>]] are common compounds. PF<sub>5</sub> is a colourless gas and the molecules have [[trigonal bipyramid|trigonal bypramidal]] geometry. PCl<sub>5</sub> is a colourless solid which has an ionic formulation of PCl<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> PCl<sub>6</sub><sup>−</sup>, but adopts the [[trigonal bipyramid|trigonal bypramidal]] geometry when molten or in the vapour phase.<ref name=Greenwood/> [[phosphorus pentabromide|PBr<sub>5</sub>]] is an unstable solid formulated as PBr<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>Br<sup>−</sup>and [[phosphorus pentaiodide|PI<sub>5</sub>]] is not known.<ref name=Greenwood/> The pentachloride and pentafluoride are [[Lewis acid]]s. With fluoride, PF<sub>5</sub> forms PF<sub>6</sub><sup>−</sup>, an [[anion]] that is [[isoelectronic]] with SF<sub>6</sub>. The most important oxyhalide is [[phosphorus oxychloride]], (POCl<sub>3</sub>), which is approximately tetrahedral.

Before extensive computer calculations were feasible, it was thought that bonding in phosphorus(V) compounds involved ''d'' orbitals. Computer modeling of [[molecular orbital theory]] indicates that this bonding involves only s- and p-orbitals.<ref>{{Cite journal|author = Kutzelnigg, W.|title = Chemical Bonding in Higher Main Group Elements|url = http://web.uvic.ca/~chem421/ACIE_1984_Kutzelnigg_review.pdf| doi = 10.1002/anie.198402721| journal = Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. |volume = 23|pages = 272–295|date = 1984|issue = 4}}</ref>

===Phosphorus(III)===
All four symmetrical trihalides are well known: gaseous [[phosphorus trifluoride|PF<sub>3</sub>]], the yellowish liquids [[phosphorus trichloride|PCl<sub>3</sub>]] and [[phosphorus tribromide|PBr<sub>3</sub>]], and the solid [[phosphorus triiodide|PI<sub>3</sub>]]. These materials are moisture sensitive, hydrolysing to give [[phosphorous acid]]. The trichloride, a common reagent, is produced by chlorination of white phosphorus:
:P<sub>4</sub> + 6 Cl<sub>2</sub> → 4 PCl<sub>3</sub>
The trifluoride is produced from the trichloride by halide exchange. PF<sub>3</sub> is toxic because it binds to [[haemoglobin]].

[[Phosphorus trioxide|Phosphorus(III) oxide]], P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub> (also called tetraphosphorus hexoxide) is the anhydride of P(OH)<sub>3</sub>, the minor tautomer of phosphorous acid. The structure of P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub> is like that of P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub> without the terminal oxide groups.

===Phosphorus(I) and phosphorus(II)===
[[File:YoshifujiR2P2.png|thumb|right|A stable [[diphosphene]], a derivative of phosphorus(I).]]
These compounds generally feature P-P bonds.<ref name=Greenwood>Greenwood, N. N.; & Earnshaw, A. (1997). Chemistry of the Elements (2nd Edn.), Oxford:Butterworth-Heinemann. {{ISBN|0-7506-3365-4}}.</ref> Examples include catenated derivatives of phosphine and organophosphines.  Compounds containing P=P double bonds have also been observed, although they are rare.

===Phosphides and phosphines===
Phosphides arise by reaction of metals with red phosphorus. The alkali metals (group 1) and alkaline earth metals can form ionic compounds containing the [[phosphide]] ion, P<sup>3−</sup>. These compounds react with water to form [[phosphine]]. Other phosphides, for example Na<sub>3</sub>P<sub>7</sub>, are known for these reactive metals. With the transition metals as well as the monophosphides there are metal rich phosphides, which are generally hard refractory compounds with a metallic lustre, and phosphorus rich phosphides which are less stable and include semiconductors.<ref>Greenwood</ref> [[Schreibersite]] is a naturally occurring metal rich phosphide found in meteorites. The structures of the metal rich and phosphorus rich phosphides  can be structurally complex.

[[Phosphine]] (PH<sub>3</sub>) and its organic derivatives (PR<sub>3</sub>) are structural analogues with ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) but the bond angles at phosphorus are closer to 90° for phosphine and its organic derivatives. It is an ill-smelling, toxic compound. Phosphorus has an oxidation number of -3 in phosphine. Phosphine is produced by hydrolysis of [[calcium phosphide]], Ca<sub>3</sub>P<sub>2</sub>. Unlike ammonia, phosphine is oxidised by air. Phosphine is also far less basic than ammonia. Other phophines are known which contain chains of up to nine phosphorus atoms and have the formula P<sub>n</sub>H<sub>n+2</sub>.<ref name=Greenwood/> The highly flammable gas [[diphosphine]] (P<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>) is an analogue of [[hydrazine]].

===Oxoacids===
Phosphorous oxoacids are extensive, often commercially important, and sometimes structurally complicated. They all have acidic protons bound to oxygen atoms, some have nonacidic protons that are bonded directly to phosphorus and some contain phosphorus - phosphorus bonds.<ref name=Greenwood/> Although many oxoacids of phosphorus are formed, only nine are important, and three of them, [[hypophosphorous acid]], [[phosphorous acid]], and phosphoric acid, are particularly important.

Similarly, H<sub>2</sub>PN is considered unstable, and phosphorus nitride halogens like F<sub>2</sub>PN, Cl<sub>2</sub>PN, Br<sub>2</sub>PN, and I<sub>2</sub>PN oligomerise into cyclic [[Polyphosphazene]]s. For example, compounds of the formula (PNCl<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub> exist mainly as rings such as the [[trimer (chemistry)|trimer]] [[hexachlorophosphazene]]. The phosphazenes arise by treatment of phosphorus pentachloride with ammonium chloride:<blockquote>PCl<sub>5</sub> + NH<sub>4</sub>Cl → 1/''n'' (NPCl<sub>2</sub>)<sub>''n''</sub> + 4 HCl</blockquote>When the chloride groups are replaced by [[alkoxide]] (RO<sup>−</sup>), a family of polymers is produced with potentially useful properties.<ref>Mark, J. E.; Allcock, H. R.; West, R. "Inorganic Polymers" Prentice Hall, Englewood, NJ: 1992. {{ISBN|0-13-465881-7}}.</ref>

===Sulfides===
{{main|phosphorus sulfide}}
Phosphorus forms a wide range of sulfides, where the phosphorus can be in P(V), P(III) or other oxidation states. The most famous is the three-fold symmetric P<sub>4</sub>S<sub>3</sub> which is used in strike-anywhere matches. P<sub>4</sub>S<sub>10</sub> and P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub> have analogous structures.<ref>Heal, H. G. "The Inorganic Heterocyclic Chemistry of Sulfur, Nitrogen, and Phosphorus" Academic Press: London; 1980. {{ISBN|0-12-335680-6}}.</ref> Mixed oxyhalides and oxyhydrides of phosphorus(III) are almost unknown.

===Organophosphorus compounds===
{{Main|organophosphorus compounds}}
Compounds with P-C and P-O-C bonds are often classified as organophosphorus compounds. They are widely used commercially. The PCl<sub>3</sub> serves as a source of P<sup>3+</sup> in routes to organophosphorus(III) compounds. For example, it is the precursor to [[triphenylphosphine]]:
:PCl<sub>3</sub> + 6 Na + 3 C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Cl → P(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub> + 6 NaCl
Treatment of phosphorus trihalides with alcohols and [[phenol]]s gives phosphites, e.g. [[triphenylphosphite]]:
:PCl<sub>3</sub> + 3 C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH → P(OC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub> + 3 HCl
Similar reactions occur for [[phosphorus oxychloride]], affording [[triphenylphosphate]]:
:OPCl<sub>3</sub> + 3 C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH → OP(OC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub> + 3 HCl

==History ==
The name ''Phosphorus'' in Ancient Greece was the name for the planet [[Venus]] and is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words (φῶς = light, φέρω = carry), which roughly translates as light-bringer or light carrier.<ref name="mellor-717"/> (In [[Greek mythology]] and tradition, Augerinus (Αυγερινός = morning star, still in use today), Hesperus or Hesperinus (΄Εσπερος or Εσπερινός or Αποσπερίτης = evening star, still in use today) and Eosphorus (Εωσφόρος = dawnbearer, not in use for the planet after Christianity) are close homologues, and also associated with Phosphorus-the-planet).

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the correct spelling of the element is '''phosphorus'''. The word '''phosphorous''' is the adjectival form of the P<sup>3+</sup> valence: so, just as [[sulfur]] forms sulfur'''ous''' and sulfur'''ic''' compounds, phosphor'''us''' forms phosphor'''ous''' compounds (e.g., [[phosphorous acid]]) and P<sup>5+</sup> valence phosphor'''ic''' compounds (e.g., [[phosphoric acids and phosphates]]).

===Discovery===
[[File:Robert boyle.jpg|thumb|upright|Robert Boyle]]
The discovery of phosphorus, the first element to be discovered that was not known since ancient times,<ref>{{cite journal | doi =  10.1021/ed009p11| title =  The discovery of the elements. II. Elements known to the alchemists| journal =  Journal of Chemical Education| volume =  9| pages =  11| date =  1932| last1 =  Weeks| first1 =  Mary Elvira| bibcode =  1932JChEd...9...11W}}</ref> is credited to the German alchemist [[Hennig Brand]] in 1669, although other chemists might have discovered phosphorus around the same time.<ref name="disc">{{Cite book|title=Phosphorus|author=Beatty, Richard|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FHJIUJM1_JUC&pg=PA7|page=7|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|date=2000|isbn=0-7614-0946-7}}</ref> Brand experimented with [[urine]], which contains considerable quantities of dissolved phosphates from normal metabolism.<ref name="mellor-717" /> Working in [[Hamburg]], Brand attempted to create the fabled [[philosopher's stone]] through the [[distillation]] of some [[salt]]s by evaporating [[urine]], and in the process produced a white material that glowed in the dark and burned brilliantly. It was named ''phosphorus mirabilis'' ("miraculous bearer of light").<ref name="schmundt">[http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,690450-2,00.html "Experts Warn of Impending Phosphorus Crisis"], by Hilmar Schmundt, ''[[Der Spiegel|Spiegel]]'', 21 April 2010</ref>

Brand's process originally involved letting urine stand for days until it gave off a terrible smell. Then he boiled it down to a paste, heated this paste to a high temperature, and led the vapours through water, where he hoped they would condense to gold. Instead, he obtained a white, waxy substance that glowed in the dark. Brand had discovered phosphorus. We now know that Brand produced ammonium sodium hydrogen phosphate, {{chem|(NH|4|)NaHPO|4}}. While the quantities were essentially correct (it took about {{convert|1,100|L|gal|disp=x| [|]}} of urine to make about 60&nbsp;g of phosphorus), it was unnecessary to allow the urine to rot. Later scientists discovered that fresh urine yielded the same amount of phosphorus.<ref name="sommers" />

Brand at first tried to keep the method secret,<ref>{{Cite book| first=J. M. |last=Stillman|title = The Story of Alchemy and Early Chemistry |location = New York|publisher = Dover|date = 1960|pages = 418–419| isbn = 0-7661-3230-7}}</ref> but later sold the recipe for 200 thalers to D. Krafft from Dresden,<ref name="mellor-717"/> who could now make it as well, and toured much of Europe with it, including England, where he met with [[Robert Boyle]]. The secret that it was made from urine leaked out and first [[Johann von Löwenstern-Kunckel|Johann Kunckel]] (1630–1703) in Sweden (1678) and later Boyle in London (1680) also managed to make phosphorus, possibly with the aid of his assistant, [[Ambrose Godfrey|Ambrose Godfrey-Hanckwitz]], who later made a business of the manufacture of phosphorus.

Boyle states that Krafft gave him no information as to the preparation of phosphorus other than that it was derived from "somewhat that belonged to the body of man". This gave Boyle a valuable clue, so that he, too, managed to make phosphorus, and published the method of its manufacture.<ref name="mellor-717" /> Later he improved Brand's process by using sand in the reaction (still using urine as base material),

: 4 {{chem|NaPO|3}} + 2 {{chem|SiO|2}} + 10 C → 2 {{chem|Na|2|SiO|3}} + 10 CO + {{chem|P|4}}

Robert Boyle was the first to use phosphorus to ignite sulfur-tipped wooden splints, forerunners of our modern matches, in 1680.<ref>{{cite book|title=Metabolism of the Anthroposphere|author=Peter Baccini|author2=Paul H. Brunner|publisher=MIT Press, 2012|isbn=0262300540|page=288}}</ref>

Phosphorus was the 13th element to be discovered. For this reason, and due to its use in explosives, poisons and nerve agents, it is sometimes referred to as "the Devil's element".<ref>{{cite book|author=John Emsley|title=The 13th Element: The Sordid Tale of Murder, Fire, and Phosphorus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D8IMOQAACAAJ|accessdate=2012-02-03|date=7 January 2002|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-471-44149-6}}</ref>

===Bone ash and guano===
[[File:DSCN5766-guano-glantz crop b.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Guano]] mining in the Central [[Chincha Islands]], ca. 1860.]]
In 1769, [[Johan Gottlieb Gahn]] and [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] showed that calcium phosphate ({{chem|Ca|3|(PO|4|)|2}}) is found in bones, and they obtained elemental phosphorus from [[bone ash]]. [[Antoine Lavoisier]] recognised phosphorus as an element in 1777.<ref>cf. "[http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/Lavoisier1.html Memoir on Combustion in General]" ''Mémoires de l'Académie Royale des Sciences'' 1777, 592–600. from Henry Marshall Leicester and Herbert S. Klickstein, ''A Source Book in Chemistry 1400–1900'' (New York: McGraw Hill, 1952)</ref> Bone ash was the major source of phosphorus until the 1840s. The method started by roasting bones, then employed the use of clay [[retorts]] encased in a very hot brick furnace to distill out the highly toxic elemental phosphorus product.<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomson, Robert Dundas |title=Dictionary of chemistry with its applications to mineralogy, physiology and the arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1LxBAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA416|year=1870|publisher=Rich. Griffin and Company|page=416}}</ref> Alternately, precipitated phosphates could be made from ground-up bones that had been de-greased and treated with strong acids. White phosphorus could then be made by heating the precipitated phosphates, mixed with ground coal or [[charcoal]] in an iron pot, and distilling off phosphorus vapour in a [[retort]].<ref name="threlfall-v">{{harvnb|Threlfall|1951|pages=49–66}}</ref> [[Carbon monoxide]] and other flammable gases produced during the reduction process were burnt off in a [[Gas flare|flare stack]].

In the 1840s, world phosphate production turned to the mining of tropical island deposits formed from bird and bat [[guano]] (see also [[Guano Islands Act]]). These became an important source of phosphates for fertiliser in the latter half of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bioceramic Coatings for Medical Implants|author=Robert B. Heimann|author2=Hans D. Lehmann|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, 2015|isbn=352768400X|page=4}}</ref>

===Phosphate rock===
[[Phosphate rock]], which usually contains calcium phosphate, was first used in 1850 to make phosphorus, and following the introduction of the electric arc furnace by [[James Burgess Readman]] in 1888<ref>The Chemistry of Phosphorus, by Arthur Toy</ref> (patented 1889)<ref>US patent 417943</ref>, elemental phosphorus production switched from the bone-ash heating, to electric arc production from phosphate rock. After the depletion of world guano sources about the same time, mineral phosphates became the major source of phosphate fertiliser production. Phosphate rock production greatly increased after World War II, and remains the primary global source of phosphorus and phosphorus chemicals today. See the article on [[peak phosphorus]] for more information on the history and present state of phosphate mining. Phosphate rock remains a feedstock in the fertiliser industry, where it is treated with sulfuric acid to produce various "[[superphosphate]]" fertiliser products.

===Incendiaries===
White phosphorus was first made commercially in the 19th century for the [[match]] industry. This used bone ash for a phosphate source, as described above. The bone-ash process became obsolete when the [[submerged-arc furnace for phosphorus production]] was introduced to reduce phosphate rock.<ref name="threlfall-vii">{{harvnb|Threlfall|1951|pages=81–101}}</ref><ref name="mellor-718-720">{{harvnb|Parkes|Mellor|1939|page=718–720}}.</ref> The electric furnace method allowed production to increase to the point where phosphorus could be used in weapons of war.<ref name="shockinghistory"/><ref name="threlfall-xi">{{harvnb|Threlfall|1951|pages=167–185}}</ref> In [[World War I]], it was used in incendiaries, [[smoke screen]]s and tracer bullets.<ref name="threlfall-xi"/> A special incendiary bullet was developed to shoot at [[hydrogen]]-filled [[Zeppelin]]s over Britain (hydrogen being highly [[flammable]]).<ref name="threlfall-xi"/> During [[World War II]], [[Molotov cocktail]]s made of phosphorus dissolved in [[petrol]] were distributed in Britain to specially selected civilians within the British resistance operation, for defence; and phosphorus incendiary bombs were used in war on a large scale. Burning phosphorus is difficult to extinguish and if it splashes onto human skin it has horrific effects.<ref name=Greenwood/>

Early matches used white phosphorus in their composition, which was dangerous due to its toxicity. Murders, suicides and accidental [[poison]]ings resulted from its use. (An apocryphal tale tells of a woman attempting to murder her husband with white phosphorus in his food, which was detected by the stew's giving off luminous steam).<ref name="shockinghistory"/> In addition, exposure to the vapours gave match workers a severe [[necrosis]] of the bones of the jaw, the infamous "[[phossy jaw]]". When a safe process for manufacturing red phosphorus was discovered, with its far lower flammability and toxicity, laws were enacted, under the [[Berne Convention (1906)]], requiring its adoption as a safer alternative for match manufacture.<ref name=phbook>{{Cite book| pages= 1486–1489| url =https://books.google.com/?id=cvJuLqBxGUcC&pg=PA1487| title = Goldfrank's toxicologic emergencies| author=Lewis R.

==Production==

Most production of phosphorus-bearing material is for agriculture fertilisers. For this purpose, phosphate minerals are converted to [[phosphoric acid]]. It follows two distinct chemical routes, the main one being treatment of phosphate minerals with sulfuric acid. The other process utilises white phosphorus, which may be produced by reaction and distillation from very low grade phosphate sources. The white phosphorus is then oxidised to phosphoric acid and subsequently neutralised with base to give phosphate salts. Phosphoric acid produced from white phosphorus is relatively pure and is the main route for the production of phosphates for all purposes, including detergent production.

In the early 1990s, Albright and Wilson's purified wet phosphoric acid business was being adversely affected by phosphate rock sales by China and the entry of their long-standing Moroccan phosphate suppliers into the purified wet phosphoric acid business.<ref name="podger-287-298">{{harvnb|Podger|2002|pages=297–298}}</ref>

=== Peak phosphorus ===
{{Main|Peak phosphorus}}
In 2017, the USGS estimated 68 billion tons of world reserves, where reserve figures refer to the amount assumed recoverable at current market prices; 0.261 billion tons were mined in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/phosphate_rock/mcs-2017-phosp.pdf|title=Phosphate Rock|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=USGS|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-03-20}}</ref> Critical to contemporary agriculture, its annual demand is rising nearly twice as fast as the growth of the human population.<ref name="MJ" />

Earnshaw, authors of the textbook, ''Chemistry of the Elements,'' however, phosphorus comprises about 0.1% by mass of the average rock, and consequently the Earth's supply is vast, although dilute.<ref name="Greenwood" />

===Elemental phosphorus===
Presently, about {{convert|1000000|ST|lk=on}} of elemental phosphorus is produced annually. Calcium phosphate (phosphate rock), mostly mined in Florida and North Africa, can be heated to 1,200–1,500&nbsp;°C with sand, which is mostly {{chem|SiO|2}}, and [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] (refined coal) to produce vaporised {{chem|P|4}}. The product is subsequently condensed into a white powder under water to prevent oxidation by air. Even under water, [[white phosphorus]] is slowly converted to the more stable red phosphorus [[allotrope]]. The chemical equation for this process when starting with fluoroapatite, a common phosphate mineral, is:
:4 Ca<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>F + 18 SiO<sub>2</sub> + 30 C → 3 P<sub>4</sub> + 30 CO + 18 CaSiO<sub>3</sub> + 2 CaF<sub>2</sub>
Side products from this process include ferrophosphorus, a crude form of Fe<sub>2</sub>P, resulting from iron impurities in the mineral precursors. The silicate [[slag]] is a useful construction material. The fluoride is sometimes recovered for use in [[water fluoridation]]. More problematic is a "mud" containing significant amounts of white phosphorus. Production of white phosphorus is conducted in large facilities in part because it is energy intensive. The white phosphorus is transported in molten form. Some major accidents have occurred during transportation; train derailments at [[Brownstone|Brownston, Nebraska]] and [[Miamisburg, Ohio]] led to large fires. The worst incident in recent times was an environmental contamination in 1968 when the sea was polluted from spillage and/or inadequately treated sewage from a white phosphorus plant at [[Placentia Bay, Newfoundland]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.heritage.nf.ca/law/erco.html| accessdate = 2009-06-06| title= ERCO and Long Harbour| publisher = Memorial University of Newfoundland and the C.R.B. Foundation}}</ref>

Another process by which elemental phosphorus is extracted includes applying at high temperatures (1500&nbsp;°C):<ref>Shriver, Atkins. Inorganic Chemistry, Fifth Edition. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York; 2010; p. 379.</ref>

:2 Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 6 SiO<sub>2</sub> + 10 C → 6 CaSiO<sub>3</sub> + 10 CO + P<sub>4</sub>

Historically, before the development of mineral-based extractions, white phosphorus was isolated on an industrial scale from bone ash.<ref>{{cite book|last=Von Wagner|first=Rudolf|title=Manual of chemical technology|date=1897|publisher=D. Appleton & Co.|location=New York|page=411|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc2.ark:/13960/t3tt4gz1p;view=1up;seq=439}}</ref> In this process, the [[tricalcium phosphate]] in bone ash is converted to [[monocalcium phosphate]] with [[sulfuric acid]]:
:Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> → Ca(H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2 CaSO<sub>4</sub>

[[Monocalcium phosphate]] is then dehydrated to the corresponding metaphosphate:
:Ca(H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> → Ca(PO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O

When ignited to a white heat with [[charcoal]], calcium metaphosphate yields two-thirds of its weight of white phosphorus while one-third of the phosphorus remains in the residue as calcium orthophosphate:
:3 Ca(PO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>  +  10 C   →   Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>  +  10 CO  +  P<sub>4</sub>

==Applications==
===Fertiliser===
{{Main|Fertiliser}}
Phosphorus is an essential plant nutrient (often the limiting nutrient), and the bulk of all phosphorus production is in concentrated phosphoric acids for [[agriculture]] [[fertiliser]]<nowiki/>s, containing as much as 70% to 75% P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. Its annual demand is rising nearly twice as fast as the growth of the human population. That led to large increase in [[phosphate]] (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup>) production in the second half of the 20th century.<ref name=MJ>{{cite news|url=http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/05/fertilizer-peak-phosphorus-shortage|title=You Need Phosphorus to Live—and We're Running Out|last=Philpott|first=Tom|date=March–April 2013|publisher=''Mother Jones''}}</ref> Artificial phosphate fertilisation is necessary because phosphorus is essential to all life organisms, natural phosphorus-bearing compounds are mostly insoluble and inaccessible to plants, and the natural cycle of phosphorus is very slow.  Fertiliser is often in the form of superphosphate of lime, a mixture of calcium dihydrogen phosphate (Ca(H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>), and calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO<sub>4</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O) produced reacting sulfuric acid and water with calcium phosphate.

Processing phosphate minerals with sulfuric acid for obtaining fertiliser is so important to the global economy that this is the primary industrial market for [[sulfuric acid]] and the greatest industrial use of elemental [[sulfur]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Industrial Minerals & Rocks: Commodities, Markets, and Uses|editor=Jessica Elzea Kogel|publisher=SME, 2006|isbn=0873352335|page=964}}</ref>

Such matches are difficult to ignite on any surface other than a special strip.

==Biological role==
Inorganic phosphorus in the form of the phosphate {{chem|PO|4|3-}} is required for all known forms of [[life]].<ref>Ruttenberg, K.C. [http://www.libraryindex.com/pages/3375/Phosphorus-Cycle.html Phosphorus Cycle – Terrestrial Phosphorus Cycle, Transport of Phosphorus], from ''Continents to the Ocean, The Marine Phosphorus Cycle''. ([http://archive.li/6amcz archived link])</ref> Phosphorus plays a major role in the structural framework of [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]. Living cells use phosphate to transport cellular energy with [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), necessary for every cellular process that uses energy.  ATP is also important for [[phosphorylation]], a key regulatory event in cells.  [[Phospholipid]]s are the main structural components of all cellular membranes. [[Calcium phosphate]] <nowiki/>salts assist in stiffening [[bone]]s.<ref name=Greenwood/>

Every living cell is encased in a membrane that separates it from its surroundings. Cellular membranes are composed of a phospholipid matrix and proteins, typically in the form of a bilayer. Phospholipids are derived from [[glycerol]] with two of the glycerol hydroxyl (OH) protons replaced by fatty acids as an [[ester]], and the third hydroxyl proton has been replaced with phosphate bonded to another alcohol.<ref>Nelson, D. L.; Cox, M. M. "Lehninger, Principles of Biochemistry" 3rd Ed. Worth Publishing: New York, 2000. {{ISBN|1-57259-153-6}}.</ref>

An average adult human contains about 0.7&nbsp;kg of phosphorus, about 85–90% in bones and teeth in the form of [[apatite]], and the remainder in soft tissues and extracellular fluids (~1%). The phosphorus content increases from about 0.5 weight% in infancy to 0.65–1.1 weight% in adults. Average phosphorus concentration in the blood is about 0.4 g/L, about 70% of that is organic and 30% inorganic phosphates.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ba_5OSsyS4YC&pg=PA171|page=171|title=Nutrition for the Middle Aged and Elderly|author= Bernhardt, Nancy E.|author2= Kasko, Artur M.|publisher=Nova Publishers|date=2008|isbn=1-60456-146-7}}</ref> An adult with healthy diet consumes and excretes about 1–3&nbsp;grams of phosphorus per day, with consumption in the form of inorganic phosphate and phosphorus-containing biomolecules such as nucleic acids and phospholipids; and excretion almost exclusively in the form of phosphate ions such as {{chem|H|2|PO|4|-}} and {{chem|HPO|4|2-}}. Only about 0.1% of body phosphate circulates in the blood, paralleling the amount of phosphate available to soft tissue cells.

===Bone and teeth enamel===
The main component of bone is [[hydroxyapatite]] as well as amorphous forms of calcium phosphate, possibly including carbonate. Hydroxyapatite is the main component of tooth enamel. [[Water fluoridation]] enhances the resistance of teeth to decay by the partial conversion of this mineral to the still harder material called fluoroapatite:<ref name=Greenwood/>

===Phosphorus deficiency===
In medicine, phosphate deficiency syndrome may be caused by [[malnutrition]], by failure to absorb phosphate, and by metabolic syndromes that draw phosphate from the blood (such as in [[Refeeding syndrome | refeeding syndrome]] after malnutrition<ref name=pmid18583681>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mehanna HM, Moledina J, Travis J |title=Refeeding syndrome: what it is, and how to prevent and treat it |journal=BMJ |volume=336 |issue=7659 |pages=1495–8 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18583681 |pmc=2440847 |doi=10.1136/bmj.a301 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18583681}}</ref>) or pass too much of it into the urine. All are characterised by [[hypophosphatemia]], which is a condition of low levels of soluble phosphate levels in the blood serum and inside the cells. Symptoms of hypophosphatemia include neurological dysfunction and disruption of muscle and blood cells due to lack of ATP. Too much phosphate can lead to diarrhoea and calcification (hardening) of organs and soft tissue, and can interfere with the body's ability to use iron, calcium, magnesium, and zinc.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anderson |first=John J. B. |date=1996 |title=Calcium, Phosphorus and Human Bone Development |journal=[[Journal of Nutrition]] |volume=126 |issue=4 Suppl. |pages=1153S–1158S|pmid=8642449}}</ref>

Phosphorus is an essential [[macromineral]] for plants, which is studied extensively in [[edaphology]] to understand plant uptake from [[soil]] systems.  Phosphorus is a [[limiting factor]] in many [[ecosystem]]s; that is, the scarcity of phosphorus limits the rate of organism growth.  An excess of phosphorus can also be problematic, especially in aquatic systems where [[eutrophication]] sometimes leads to [[algal blooms]].<ref name=MJ/>

===Dietary recommendations===
The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for phosphorus in 1997. If there is not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs, an estimate designated [[Adequate Intake]] (AI) is used instead. The current EAR for phosphorus for people ages 19 and up is 580 mg/day. The RDA is 700 mg/day. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. RDA for pregnancy and lactation are also 700 mg/day. For children ages 1–18 years the RDA increases with age from 460 to 1250 mg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets [[Tolerable upper intake level]]s (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of phosphorus the UL is 4000 mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s (DRIs).<ref name="DRItext">{{cite book | last1 = [[Institute of Medicine]] | title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium, Phosphorus, Magnesium, Vitamin D, and Fluoride | chapter = Phosphorus | publisher = The National Academies Press | year = 1997 | location = Washington, DC | pages = 146-189 | url = https://www.nap.edu/read/5776/chapter/7}}</ref>

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. For people ages 15 and older, including pregnancy and lactation, the AI is set at 550 mg/day. For children ages 4-10 years the AI is 440 mg/day, for ages 11-17 640 mg/day. These AIs are lower than the U.S RDAs. In both systems, teenagers need more than adults.<ref>{{cite web | title = Overview on Dietary Reference Values for the EU population as derived by the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies| year = 2017| url = https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf}}</ref> The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and decided that there was not sufficient information to set a UL.<ref>{{citation| title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf}}</ref>

For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For phosphorus labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 1000 mg, but as of May 27, 2016 it was revised to 1250 mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA.<ref name="FedReg">{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-27/pdf/2016-11867.pdf |title=Federal Register May 27, 2016 Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels. FR page 33982.}}</ref> A table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at [[Reference Daily Intake]]. The original deadline to be in compliance was July 28, 2018, but on September 29, 2017 the FDA released a proposed rule that extended the deadline to January 1, 2020 for large companies and January 1, 2021 for small companies.<ref name="FDAdelay"> [https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm385663.htm#dates "Changes to the Nutrition Facts Panel - Compliance Date"]</ref>

===Food sources===
The main food sources for phosphorus are the same as those containing protein, although proteins do not contain phosphorus.  For example, milk, meat, and soya typically also have phosphorus. As a rule, if a diet has sufficient protein and calcium, the amount of phosphorus is probably sufficient.<ref>[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002424.htm Phosphorus in diet: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia]. Nlm.nih.gov (2011-11-07). Retrieved on 2011-11-19.</ref>

==Precautions==
[[File:Phosphorus explosion.gif|thumb|Phosphorus explosion]]
Organic compounds of phosphorus form a wide class of materials; many are required for life, but some are extremely toxic. Fluorophosphate [[ester]]s are among the most potent [[neurotoxin]]s known. A wide range of organophosphorus compounds are used for their toxicity as [[pesticides]] ([[herbicides]], [[insecticides]], [[fungicides]], etc.) and [[weapon]]ised as nerve agents against enemy humans. Most inorganic phosphates are relatively nontoxic and essential nutrients.<ref name=Greenwood/>

The white phosphorus allotrope presents a significant hazard because it ignites in air and produces phosphoric acid residue. Chronic white phosphorus poisoning leads to necrosis of the jaw called "[[phossy jaw]]". White phosphorus is [[toxicity|toxic]], causing severe liver damage on ingestion and may cause a condition known as "Smoking Stool Syndrome".<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.emedicine.com/EMERG/topic918.htm|title = CBRNE – Incendiary Agents, White Phosphorus (Smoking Stool Syndrome)| accessdate = 2009-05-05}}</ref>

In the past, external exposure to elemental phosphorus was treated by washing the affected area with 2% [[copper sulfate]] solution to form harmless compounds that are then washed away. According to the recent ''US Navy's Treatment of Chemical Agent Casualties and Conventional Military Chemical Injuries: FM8-285: Part 2 Conventional Military Chemical Injuries'', "Cupric (copper(II)) sulfate has been used by U.S. personnel in the past and is still being used by some nations. However, copper sulfate is toxic and its use will be discontinued. Copper sulfate may produce kidney and cerebral toxicity as well as intravascular hemolysis."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vnh.org/FM8285/Chapter/chapter9.html |title=US Navy's Treatment of Chemical Agent Casualties and Conventional Military Chemical Injuries: FM8-285: Part 2 Conventional Military Chemical Injuries |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122221207/http://www.vnh.org/FM8285/Chapter/chapter9.html |archivedate=November 22, 2005 }}</ref>

The manual suggests instead "''a bicarbonate solution to neutralise phosphoric acid, which will then allow removal of visible white phosphorus. Particles often can be located by their emission of smoke when air strikes them, or by their phosphorescence in the dark. In dark surroundings, fragments are seen as luminescent spots. Promptly [[Debridement|debride]] the burn if the patient's condition will permit removal of bits of WP (white phosphorus) that might be absorbed later and possibly produce systemic poisoning. DO NOT apply oily-based [[Topical#Ointment|ointments]] until it is certain that all WP has been removed. Following complete removal of the particles, treat the lesions as thermal burns.''"{{#tag:ref|This quote uses the word "phosphorescence", which is incorrect; WP, (white phosphorus), exhibits chemoluminescence upon exposure to air and if there is any WP in the wound, covered by tissue or fluids such as blood serum, it will not chemoluminesce until it is moved to a position where the air can get at it and activate the chemoluminescent glow, which requires a very dark room and dark-adapted eyes to see clearly|group=note}}{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} As white phosphorus readily mixes with oils, any oily substances or ointments are not recommended until the area is thoroughly cleaned and all white phosphorus removed.

People can be exposed to phosphorus in the workplace by inhalation, ingestion, skin contact, and eye contact. The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the phosphorus exposure limit ([[Permissible exposure limit]]) in the workplace at 0.1&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> over an 8-hour workday. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[Recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 0.1&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 5&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup>, phosphorus is [[IDLH|immediately dangerous to life and health]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards - Phosphorus (yellow)|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0507.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-21}}</ref>

Serotonin secreted from the [[enterochromaffin cells]] eventually finds its way out of tissues into the blood. There, it is actively taken up by blood [[platelet]]s, which store it. When the platelets bind to a clot, they release serotonin, where it can serve as a [[vasoconstriction|vasoconstrictor]] and/or a vasodilator while regulating [[hemostasis]] and blood clotting. In high concentrations, serotonin acts as a vasoconstrictor by contracting endothelial smooth muscle directly or by potentiating the effects of other vasoconstrictors (e.g. angiotensin II, norepinephrine). The vasoconstrictive property is mostly seen in pathologic states affecting the endothelium such as atherosclerosis or chronic hypertension. In physiologic states, vasodilation occurs through the serotonin mediated release of nitric oxide from endothelial cells. Additionally, it inhibits the release of norepinephrine from adrenergic nerves.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vanhoutte PM | title = Serotonin and the vascular wall | journal = International Journal of Cardiology | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 189–203 | date = February 1987 | pmid = 3818135 | doi = 10.1016/0167-5273(87)90008-8 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3818135 }}</ref> Serotonin is also a growth factor for some types of cells, which may give it a role in wound healing. There are various [[5-HT receptor|serotonin receptors]].

Serotonin is metabolized mainly to [[5-HIAA]], chiefly by the liver.  Metabolism involves first [[oxidation]] by [[monoamine oxidase]] to the corresponding [[aldehyde]].  This is followed by oxidation by [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] to 5-HIAA,  the indole acetic acid derivative.   The latter is then excreted by the kidneys.

Aside from mammals it is found in all [[bilateria|bilateral animals]] including worms and insects, as well as in [[fungi]] and [[plant]]s. Serotonin's presence in insect venoms and plant spines serves to cause pain, which is a side-effect of serotonin injection.<ref name="Chen_2010" /> Serotonin is produced by pathogenic amoebae, and its effect in the human gut is diarrhea.<ref name="pmid6308760"/> Its widespread presence in many seeds and fruits may serve to stimulate the digestive tract into expelling the seeds.<ref name=feld/>

This may somewhat depend on how much serotonin the organism has at its disposal.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Cellular effects===

====Receptors====
{{Main article|5-HT receptor}}
The [[5-HT receptor]]s, the [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] for serotonin, are located on the cell membrane of [[Neuron|nerve cells]] and other cell types in animals, and mediate the effects of serotonin as the [[endogenous]] [[ligand]] and of a broad range of pharmaceutical and [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic drugs]]. Except for the [[5-HT3|5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor]], a ligand-gated [[ion channel]], all other 5-HT receptors are [[G-protein-coupled receptors]] (also called seven-transmembrane, or heptahelical receptors) that activate an [[intracellular]] [[second messenger]] cascade.<ref name="pmid18571247">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hannon J, Hoyer D | title = Molecular biology of 5-HT receptors | journal = Behavioural Brain Research | volume = 195 | issue = 1 | pages = 198–213 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18571247 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbr.2008.03.020 }}</ref>

====Termination====
Serotonergic action is terminated primarily via [[reuptake|uptake]] of 5-HT from the synapse. This is accomplished through the specific [[monoamine transporter]] for 5-HT, [[Serotonin transporter|SERT]], on the presynaptic neuron. Various agents can inhibit 5-HT reuptake, including [[cocaine]], [[dextromethorphan]] (an [[antitussive]]), [[tricyclic antidepressants]] and [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs). A 2006 study conducted by the [[University of Washington]] suggested that a newly discovered monoamine transporter, known as [[Plasma membrane monoamine transporter|PMAT]], may account for "a significant percentage of 5-HT clearance".<ref name="pmid 1828907">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhou M, Engel K, Wang J | title = Evidence for significant contribution of a newly identified monoamine transporter (PMAT) to serotonin uptake in the human brain | journal = Biochemical Pharmacology | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | pages = 147–54 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17046718 | pmc = 1828907 | doi = 10.1016/j.bcp.2006.09.008 }}</ref>

Contrasting with the high-affinity SERT, the PMAT has been identified as a low-affinity transporter, with an apparent K<sub>m</sub> of 114 micromoles/l for serotonin; approximately 230 times higher than that of SERT. However, the PMAT, despite its relatively low serotonergic affinity, has a considerably higher transport 'capacity' than SERT, "resulting in roughly comparable uptake efficiencies to SERT in heterologous expression systems."{{cite quote|date=October 2017}} The study also suggests some SSRIs, such as [[fluoxetine]] and [[sertraline]] anti-depressants, inhibit PMAT but at [[IC50|IC<sub>50</sub>]] values which surpass the therapeutic plasma concentrations by up to four orders of magnitude. Therefore, SSRI monotherapy is "ineffective" in PMAT inhibition. At present, no known pharmaceuticals are known to appreciably inhibit PMAT at normal therapeutic doses. The PMAT also suggestively transports dopamine and norepinephrine, albeit at K<sub>m</sub> values even higher than that of 5-HT (330–15,000 μmoles/L).{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

====Serotonylation====
{{Main article|Serotonylation}}
Serotonin can also signal through a nonreceptor mechanism called serotonylation, in which serotonin modifies proteins.<ref name="pmid19859528"/> This process underlies serotonin's effects upon platelet-forming cells ([[thrombocyte]]s) in which it links to the modification of signaling enzymes called [[GTPase]]s that then trigger the release of vesicle contents by [[exocytosis]].<ref name="pmid14697203">{{cite journal | vauthors = Walther DJ, Peter JU, Winter S, Höltje M, Paulmann N, Grohmann M, Vowinckel J, Alamo-Bethencourt V, Wilhelm CS, Ahnert-Hilger G, Bader M | title = Serotonylation of small GTPases is a signal transduction pathway that triggers platelet alpha-granule release | journal = Cell | volume = 115 | issue = 7 | pages = 851–62 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14697203 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(03)01014-6 }}</ref> A similar process underlies the pancreatic release of insulin.<ref name="pmid19859528"/>

===Nervous system===

[[File:Pubmed equitativa hormonal.png|thumb|right|alt= In this drawing of the brain, the serotonergic system is red and the mesolimbic dopamine pathway is blue. There is one collection of serotonergic neurons in the upper brainstem that sends [[axon]]s upwards to the whole cerebrum, and one collection next to the cerebellum that sends axons downward to the spinal cord. Slightly forward the upper serotonergic neurons is the [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA), which contains dopaminergic neurons. These neurons' axons then connect to the [[nucleus accumbens]], [[hippocampus]] and the [[frontal cortex]]. Over the VTA is another collection of dopaminergic cells, the [[substansia nigra]], which send axons to the [[striatum]]. |Serotonin system, contrasted with the [[Mesolimbic pathway|dopamine system]]]]

The neurons of the [[raphe nuclei]] are the principal source of 5-HT release in the brain.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Frazer A, Hensler JG, | veditors = Siegel GJ, Agranoff, Bernard W, Fisher SK, Albers RW, Uhler MD |title = Basic Neurochemistry | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=bnchm|edition = Sixth|year = 1999|publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn = 0-397-51820-X|chapter = Understanding the neuroanatomical organization of serotonergic cells in the brain provides insight into the functions of this neurotransmitter|chapterurl = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Search&db=books&doptcmdl=GenBookHL&term=raphe+AND+serotonin+release+AND+bnchm%5Bbook%5D+AND+160428%5Buid%5D&rid=bnchm.section.946#949|quote = In 1964, Dahlstrom and Fuxe (discussed in [2]), using the Falck-Hillarp technique of histofluorescence, observed that the majority of serotonergic soma are found in cell body groups, which previously had been designated as the Raphe nuclei.|editor-link = George J. Siegel}}</ref>
There are nine raphe nuclei, designated B1-B9, which contain the majority of serotonin-containing neurons (some scientists chose to group the ''nuclei raphes lineares'' into one nucleus), all of which are located along the midline of the [[brainstem]], and centered on the [[reticular formation]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Binder|first1=Marc D.|last2=Hirokawa|first2=Nobutaka | name-list-format = vanc |title=encyclopedia of neuroscience|date=2009|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-23735-8|page=705}}</ref><ref>The raphe nuclei group of [[neurons]] are located along the [[reticular formation|brain stem]] from the labels '[[mesencephalon|Mid Brain]]' to '[[medulla oblongata|Oblongata]]', centered on the [[pons]]. ([[:Image:Gray715.png|See relevant image]].)</ref>
Axons from the neurons of the raphe nuclei form a [[neurotransmitter system]] reaching almost every part of the central nervous system. Axons of neurons in the lower raphe nuclei terminate in the [[cerebellum]] and [[spinal cord]], while the axons of the higher nuclei spread out in the entire brain.

====Ultrastructure and Function====
The serotonin nuclei may also be divided into two main groups, the rostral and caudal containing three and four nuclei respectively.  The rostral group consists of the caudal linear nuclei (B8), the dorsal raphe nuclei (B6 and B7) and the median raphe nuclei (B5, B8 and B9), that project into multiple cortical and subcortical structures.  The caudal group consists of the nucleus raphe magnus (B3), raphe obscurus nucleus (B2), raphe pallidus nucleus (B1), and lateral medullary reticular formation, that project into the brainstem.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jacobs|first1=edited by Christian P.

Serotonergic pathway are involved in sensorimotor function, with pathways projecting both into cortical (Dorsal and Median Raphe Nuclei), subcortical, and spinal areas involved in motor activity.  Pharmacological manipulation suggest that serotonergic activity increases with motor activity, while firing rates of serotonergic neurons increase with intense visual stimuli.  The descending projections form a pathway that inhibits pain called the "descending inhibitory pathway" that may be relevant to disorder such as fibromyalgia, migraine and other pain disorders, and the efficacy of antidepressants in them.<ref>{{cite book | chapter = Seroonin in Pain and Pain Control | last = Sommer | first = Claudia | editor-last1 = Jacobs  | editor-first1 = Christian P. | editor-last2 = Müller | editor-first2 = Barry | name-list-format = vanc |title=Handbook of the behavioral neurobiology of serotonin|date=2009|publisher=Academic|location=London|isbn=9780123746344|pages=457–460|edition=1st}}</ref>

====Microanatomy====
Serotonin is released into the synapse, or space between neurons, and diffuses over a relatively wide gap (>20&nbsp;µm) to activate [[5-HT receptor]]s located on the [[dendrite]]s, cell bodies and [[presynaptic terminal]]s of adjacent neurons.

When humans smell food, dopamine is released to [[incentive salience|increase the appetite]]. But, unlike in worms, serotonin does not increase anticipatory behaviour in humans; instead, the serotonin released while consuming activates [[5-HT2C receptor]]s on dopamine-producing cells. This halts their dopamine release, and thereby serotonin decreases appetite. Drugs that block 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors make the body unable to recognize when it is no longer hungry or otherwise in need of nutrients, and are associated with weight gain,<ref name="pmid19178394">{{cite journal | vauthors = Stahl SM, Mignon L, Meyer JM | title = Which comes first: atypical antipsychotic treatment or cardiometabolic risk? | journal = Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica | volume = 119 | issue = 3 | pages = 171–9 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19178394 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2008.01334.x }}</ref> especially in people with a low number of receptors.<ref name="pmid15741483">{{cite journal | vauthors = Buckland PR, Hoogendoorn B, Guy CA, Smith SK, Coleman SL, O'Donovan MC | title = Low gene expression conferred by association of an allele of the 5-HT2C receptor gene with antipsychotic-induced weight gain | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 162 | issue = 3 | pages = 613–5 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15741483 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.162.3.613 }}</ref> The expression of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors in the [[hippocampus]] follows a [[circadian rhythm|diurnal rhythm]],<ref name="pmid9151722">{{cite journal | vauthors = Holmes MC, French KL, Seckl JR | title = Dysregulation of diurnal rhythms of serotonin 5-HT2C and corticosteroid receptor gene expression in the hippocampus with food restriction and glucocorticoids | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 17 | issue = 11 | pages = 4056–65 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9151722 }}</ref> just as the serotonin release in the [[ventromedial nucleus]], which is characterised by a peak at morning when the motivation to eat is strongest.<ref name="pmid2197074">{{cite journal | vauthors = Leibowitz SF | title = The role of serotonin in eating disorders | journal = Drugs | volume = 39 Suppl 3 | pages = 33–48 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2197074 | doi = 10.2165/00003495-199000393-00005 }}</ref>

The amount of food that an animal acquires  depends not only on food availability but also on the animal's ability to compete with others. This is especially true for [[Sociality|social]] animals, where the stronger individuals might steal food from the weaker (this is not to say some non-social animals do not concern themselves with the needs of others or steal food from others{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}). Thus, serotonin is involved not only in the perception of food availability but also in social rank.

In [[macaque]]s, alpha males have twice the level of serotonin released in the brain than subordinate males and females (as measured by the levels of 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the cerebro-spinal fluid). Dominance status and cerebro-serotonin levels appear to be positively correlated. When dominant males were removed from such groups, subordinate males begin competing for dominance. Once new dominance hierarchies were established, serotonin levels of the new dominant individuals also increased to double those in subordinate males and females. The reason why serotonin levels are only high in dominant males but not dominant females has not yet been established.<ref>McGuire, Michael (2013) "Believing, the neuroscience of fantasies, fears and confictions" (Prometius Books)</ref>

===Outside the nervous system===

====In the digestive tract (emetic)====
The gut is surrounded by [[enterochromaffin cell]]s, which release serotonin in response to food in the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]]. This makes the gut contract around the food. Platelets in the [[Hepatic portal system|veins draining the gut]] collect excess serotonin.

If irritants are present in the food, the enterochromaffin cells release more serotonin to make the gut move faster, i.e., to cause diarrhea, so the gut is emptied of the noxious substance. If serotonin is released in the blood faster than the platelets can absorb it, the level of free serotonin in the blood is increased. This activates [[5-HT3 receptor]]s in the [[chemoreceptor trigger zone]] that stimulate [[vomiting]].<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Rang HP |title=Pharmacology |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=Edinburgh |year=2003 |page=187 |isbn=0-443-07145-4}}</ref> The enterochromaffin cells not only react to bad food but are also very sensitive to [[Radiation therapy|irradiation]] and [[chemotherapy|cancer chemotherapy]].

===Antidepressants===
{{main article|SSRI|MAOI}}
Drugs that alter serotonin levels are used in treating [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[generalized anxiety disorder]] and [[social anxiety disorder|social phobia]]. [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs) prevent the breakdown of [[monoamine neurotransmitter]]s (including serotonin), and therefore increase concentrations of the neurotransmitter in the brain. MAOI therapy is associated with many adverse drug reactions, and patients are at risk of [[hypertensive emergency]] triggered by foods with high [[tyramine]] content, and certain drugs. Some drugs inhibit the re-uptake of serotonin, making it stay in the synaptic cleft longer. The [[tricyclic antidepressants]] (TCAs) inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin and [[norepinephrine]]. The newer [[selective and non-selective|selective]] serotonin reuptake inhibitors ([[SSRI]]s) have fewer side-effects and fewer interactions with other drugs.<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Goodman | first1 = Louis Sanford | last2 = Brunton | first2 = Laurence L. | last3 = Chabner | first3 = Bruce | last4 = Knollmann | first4 = Björn C.  | name-list-format = vanc | title = Goodman and Gilman's pharmacological basis of therapeutics | year = 2001 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | isbn = 0-07-162442-2 | pages = 459–461 }}</ref>

====Serotonin syndrome====
{{Main article|Serotonin syndrome}}
Extremely high levels of serotonin can cause a condition known as [[serotonin syndrome]], with toxic and potentially fatal effects. In practice, such toxic levels are essentially impossible to reach through an [[overdose]] of a single antidepressant drug, but require a combination of serotonergic agents, such as an [[SSRI]] with an [[MAOI]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Isbister GK, Bowe SJ, Dawson A, Whyte IM | title = Relative toxicity of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in overdose | journal = Journal of Toxicology.

===Antiemetics===
Some [[5-HT3 antagonist|5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists]], such as [[ondansetron]], [[granisetron]], and [[tropisetron]], are important [[antiemetic]] agents. They are particularly important in treating the [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]] that occur during anticancer [[chemotherapy]] using cytotoxic drugs. Another application is in the treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting.

===Other===

Some serotonergic agonist drugs cause fibrosis anywhere in the body, particularly the syndrome of [[retroperitoneal fibrosis]], as well as [[cardiac fibrosis|cardiac valve fibrosis]].<ref name="Baskin">{{cite book | vauthors = Baskin SI|title = Principles of cardiac toxicology|publisher = CRC Press|location = Boca Raton|year = 1991|isbn = 0-8493-8809-0|url = https://books.google.com/?id=AW7M6jBixj4C&pg=PA626|accessdate = 3 February 2010}}</ref>
In the past, three groups of serotonergic drugs have been epidemiologically linked with these syndromes. These are the serotonergic vasoconstrictive antimigraine drugs ([[ergotamine]] and [[methysergide]]),<ref name=Baskin/> the serotonergic appetite suppressant drugs ([[fenfluramine]], [[chlorphentermine]], and [[aminorex]]), and certain anti-Parkinsonian dopaminergic agonists, which also stimulate serotonergic 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors.

===Methyl-tryptamines and hallucinogens===
{{for|details on tryptamine neurotransmitters in humans|Trace amine}}
Several plants contain serotonin together with a family of related [[tryptamine]]s that are [[methylation|methylated]] at the [[amine|amino]] (NH<sub>2</sub>) and [[hydroxyl|(OH) groups]], are [[amine oxide|''N''-oxides]], or miss the OH group. These compounds do reach the brain, although some portion of them are metabolized by [[monoamine oxidase]] enzymes (mainly [[MAO-A]]) in the liver. Examples are plants from the ''[[Anadenanthera]]'' genus that are used in the [[hallucinogen]]ic [[yopo]] snuff. These compounds are widely present in the leaves of many plants, and may serve as deterrents for animal ingestion. Serotonin occurs in several mushrooms of the genus ''[[Panaeolus]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tyler VE | title = Occurrence of serotonin in a hallucinogenic mushroom | journal = Science | volume = 128 | issue = 3326 | pages = 718 | date = September 1958 | pmid = 13580242 | doi = 10.1126/science.128.3326.718 | bibcode = 1958Sci...128..718T }}</ref>

Low serotonin signals to the entoamoebas they are outside a host and they become less virulent to conserve energy. When they enter a new host, they multiply in the gut, and become more virulent as the enterochromaffine cells get provoked by them and the serotonin concentration increases.

===Plants===
In drying [[seed]]s, serotonin production is a way to get rid of the buildup of poisonous [[ammonia]]. The ammonia is collected and placed in the [[indole]] part of <small>L</small>-[[tryptophan]], which is then [[decarboxylation|decarboxylated]] by [[Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase|tryptophan decarboxylase]] to give tryptamine, which is then [[hydroxylation|hydroxylated]] by a [[cytochrome P450 monooxygenase]], yielding serotonin.<ref name="Schröder et al.">{{cite journal | vauthors = Schröder P, Abele C, Gohr P, Stuhlfauth-Roisch U, Grosse W | title = Latest on enzymology of serotonin biosynthesis in walnut seeds | journal = Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | volume = 467 | pages = 637–44 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10721112 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4615-4709-9_81 | isbn = 978-0-306-46204-7 | series = Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology }}</ref>

However, since serotonin is a major gastrointestinal tract modulator, it may be produced by plants in fruits as a way of speeding the passage of seeds through the digestive tract, in the same way as many well-known seed and fruit associated laxatives. Serotonin is found in [[mushroom]]s, [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s. The highest values of 25–400&nbsp;mg/kg have been found in nuts of the [[walnut]] (''Juglans'') and [[hickory]] (''Carya'') genera. Serotonin concentrations of 3–30&nbsp;mg/kg have been found in [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], [[pineapple]]s, [[banana]], [[kiwifruit]], [[plum]]s, and [[tomato]]es.

Serotonin is one compound of the poison contained in [[stinging nettle]]s (''Urtica dioica''), where it causes pain on injection in the same manner as its presence in insect venoms (see below).

===Invertebrates===
Serotonin functions as a neurotransmitter in the nervous systems of most animals. For example, in the roundworm ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', which feeds on bacteria, serotonin is released as a signal in response to positive events, such as finding a new source of food or in male animals finding a female with which to mate.<ref>Jonz, Michael G.Riga, EkateriniMercier, A. JoffrePotter, John W. "Effects Of 5-HT (Serotonin) On Reproductive Behaviour In Heterodera Schachtii (Nematoda)." Canadian Journal of Zoology 79.9 (2001): 1727. Canadian Reference Centre. Web. 11 August 2013.</ref> When a well-fed worm feels bacteria on its [[cuticle]], [[dopamine]] is released, which slows it down; if it is starved, serotonin also is released, which slows the animal down further.

In animals including humans, serotonin is [[Biosynthesis|synthesized]] from the [[amino acid]] <small>L</small>-[[tryptophan]] by a short [[metabolic pathway]] consisting of two [[enzyme]]s: [[tryptophan hydroxylase]] (TPH), [[Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase|aromatic amino acid decarboxylase]] (DDC) and the coenzyme [[pyridoxal phosphate]]. The TPH-mediated reaction is the rate-limiting step in the pathway.
TPH has been shown to exist in two forms: [[TPH1]], found in several [[Biological tissue|tissues]], and [[TPH2]], which is a neuron-specific [[Protein isoform|isoform]].<ref name="pmid14597720">{{cite journal | vauthors = Côté F, Thévenot E, Fligny C, Fromes Y, Darmon M, Ripoche MA, Bayard E, Hanoun N, Saurini F, Lechat P, Dandolo L, Hamon M, Mallet J, Vodjdani G | title = Disruption of the nonneuronal tph1 gene demonstrates the importance of peripheral serotonin in cardiac function | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 23 | pages = 13525–30 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14597720 | pmc = 263847 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.2233056100 | first14 = G | bibcode = 2003PNAS..10013525C }}</ref>

Serotonin can be synthesized from tryptophan in the lab using [[Aspergillus niger]] and [[Psilocybe coprophila]] as catalysts. The first phase to 5-hydroxytryptophan would require letting tryptophan sit in ethanol and water for 7 days, then mixing in enough HCl (or other acid) to bring the pH to 3, and then adding NaOH to make a pH of 13 for 1 hour. ''Asperigillus niger'' would be the catalyst for this first phase. The second phase to synthesizing tryptophan itself from the 5-hydroxytryptophan intermediate would require adding ethanol and water, and letting sit for 30 days this time. The next two steps would be the same as the first phase: adding HCl to make the pH = 3, and then adding NaOH to make the pH very basic at 13 for 1 hour. This phase uses the ''Psilocybe coprophila'' as the catalyst for the reaction.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Alarcon J | year = 2008 | title = Biotransformation of indole derivatives by mycelial cultures | url = | journal = Zeitschrift für Naturforschung C | volume = 63 | issue = | page = 82 | doi=10.1515/znc-2008-1-215}}</ref>

Serotonin taken orally does not pass into the serotonergic pathways of the central nervous system, because it does not cross the [[blood–brain barrier]].<ref name="pmid18043762" /> However, [[tryptophan]] and its [[metabolite]] [[5-hydroxytryptophan]] (5-HTP), from which serotonin is synthesized, does cross the blood–brain barrier. These agents are available as [[dietary supplement]]s, and may be effective serotonergic agents.
One product of serotonin breakdown is [[5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid]] (5-HIAA), which is excreted in the [[urine]]. Serotonin and 5-HIAA are sometimes produced in excess amounts by certain [[tumor]]s or [[cancer]]s, and levels of these substances may be measured in the urine to test for these tumors.

==History and etymology==
In 1935, Italian [[Vittorio Erspamer]] showed an extract from [[enterochromaffin cell]]s made intestines contract. Some believed it contained [[adrenaline]], but two years later, Erspamer was able to show it was a previously unknown [[amine]], which he named "enteramine".<ref name="pmid17526278">{{cite journal | vauthors = Negri L | title = [Vittorio Erspamer (1909-1999)] | journal = Medicina Nei Secoli | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 97–113 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17526278 | url = https://www.medicinaneisecoli.it/index.php/MedSecoli/article/view/491 }}</ref> In 1948, [[Maurice M.

In 1952, enteramine was shown to be the same substance as serotonin, and as the broad range of physiological roles was elucidated, the abbreviation 5-HT of the proper chemical name 5-hydroxytryptamine became the preferred name in the pharmacological field.<ref name="pmid13035756">{{cite journal | vauthors = Feldberg W, Toh CC | title = Distribution of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, enteramine) in the wall of the digestive tract | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 119 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 352–62 | date = February 1953 | pmid = 13035756 | pmc = 1392800 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.1953.sp004850 }}</ref> Synonyms of serotonin include: 5-hydroxytriptamine, thrombotin, enteramin, substance DS, and 3-(β-Aminoethyl)-5-hydroxyindole.<ref>SciFinder – Serotonin Substance Detail.

== Interactions ==
Clopidogrel generally has a low potential to interact with other pharmaceutical drugs. Combination with other drugs that affect blood clotting, such as [[aspirin]], [[heparin]]s and [[thrombolytic drug|thrombolytic]]s, showed no relevant interactions. [[Naproxen]] did increase the likelihood of [[occult bleeding|occult]] [[gastrointestinal bleeding]], as might be the case with other [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s. As clopidogrel inhibits the liver enzyme [[CYP2C9]] in cellular models, it has been theorized that it might increase blood plasma levels of drugs that are metabolized by this enzyme, such as [[phenytoin]] and [[tolbutamide]]. Clinical studies showed that this mechanism is irrelevant for practical purposes.<ref name="Austria-Codex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Jasek, W|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2007|edition=62nd|isbn=978-3-85200-181-4|pages=6526–7|language=German}}</ref>

== Pharmacology ==

=== Mechanism of action ===
Clopidogrel is a [[prodrug]], which is activated in two steps, first by CYP2C19, CYP1A2 and CYP2B6, then by CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2B6 and CYP3A.<ref name=Cattaneo212rev>{{cite journal|last1=Cattaneo|first1=M|title=Response variability to clopidogrel: is tailored treatment, based on laboratory testing, the right solution?|journal=Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH|date=March 2012|volume=10|issue=3|pages=327-36|doi=10.1111/j.1538-7836.2011.04602.x|pmid=22221409}}</ref>  The active metabolite then specifically and irreversibly inhibits the [[P2Y12|P2Y<sub>12</sub>]] subtype of [[ADP receptor]], which is important in activation of platelets and eventual cross-linking by the protein [[fibrin]].<ref name=Cattaneo212rev/> Platelet inhibition can be demonstrated two hours after a single dose of oral clopidogrel, but the onset of action is slow, so a loading dose of either 600 or 300&nbsp;mg is administered when a rapid effect is needed.<ref>Clopidogrel {{Drugs.com|MTM|clopidogrel}}</ref>

=== Pharmacokinetics and metabolism ===
[[File:Clopidogrel activation.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|Clopidogrel (top left) being activated: The first step is an oxidation mediated (mainly) by CYP2C19, unlike the activation of the related drug prasugrel. The two structures at the bottom are [[tautomer]]s of each other; and the final step is a hydrolysis. The active metabolite (top right) has [[E-Z notation|''Z''&nbsp;configuration]] at the double bond C3–C16 and possibly [[Chirality (chemistry)#By configuration: R- and S-|''R''&nbsp;configuration]] at the newly asymmetric C4.<ref name="metabolite">

After repeated oral doses of 75&nbsp;mg of clopidogrel (base), plasma concentrations of the parent compound, which has no platelet-inhibiting effect, are very low and, in general, are below the quantification limit (0.258&nbsp;µg/l) beyond two hours after dosing.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Clopidogrel is activated in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP2C19. Due to opening of the thiophene ring, the chemical structure of the active metabolite has three sites that are stereochemically relevant, making a total of eight possible isomers. These are: a stereocentre at C4 (attached to the —SH thiol group), a double bond at C3—C16, and the original stereocentre at C7. Only one of the eight structures is an active antiplatelet drug. This has the following configuration: ''Z'' configuration at the C3—C16 double bond, the original ''S'' configuration at C7,<ref name="metabolite" /> and, although the stereocentre at C4 cannot be directly determined, as the thiol group is too reactive, work with the active metabolite of the related drug prasugrel suggests the ''R''-configuration of the C4 group is critical for P2Y<sub>12</sub> and platelet-inhibitory activity.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The active metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 0.5 to 1.0 h, and acts by forming a disulfide bridge with the platelet ADP receptor. Patients with a variant allele of CYP2C19 are 1.5 to 3.5 times more likely to die or have complications than patients with the high-functioning allele.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mega JL, Close SL, Wiviott SD, Shen L, Hockett RD, Brandt JT, Walker JR, Antman EM, Macias W, Braunwald E, Sabatine MS | title = Cytochrome p-450 polymorphisms and response to clopidogrel | journal = [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 360 | issue = 4 | pages = 354–62 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19106084 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa0809171}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Simon T, Verstuyft C, Mary-Krause M, Quteineh L, Drouet E, Méneveau N, Steg PG, Ferrières J, Danchin N, ((Becquemont L, French Registry of Acute ST-Elevation Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (FAST-MI) Investigators)) | title = Genetic Determinants of Response to Clopidogrel and Cardiovascular Events | journal = [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 360 | issue = 4 | pages = 363–75 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19106083 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa0808227}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Collet JP, Hulot JS, Pena A, Villard E, Esteve JB, Silvain J, Payot L, Brugier D, Cayla G, Beygui F, Bensimon G, Funck-Brentano C, Montalescot G | title = Cytochrome P450 2C19 polymorphism in young patients treated with clopidogrel after myocardial infarction: a cohort study | journal = [[The Lancet]] | volume = 373 | issue = 9660 | pages = 309–17 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19108880 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61845-0}}</ref>

Following an oral dose of <sup>14</sup>C-labeled clopidogrel in humans, about 50% was excreted in the urine and 46% in the feces in the five days after dosing.

*Effect of food: Administration of clopidogrel bisulfate with meals did not significantly modify the bioavailability of clopidogrel as assessed by the pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite.
*Absorption and distribution: Clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of repeated doses of 75-milligram clopidogrel (base), with peak plasma levels (about 3&nbsp;mg/l) of the main circulating metabolite occurring around one hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite are linear (plasma concentrations increased in proportion to dose) in the dose range of 50 to 150&nbsp;mg of clopidogrel. Absorption is at least 50% based on urinary excretion of clopidogrel-related metabolites.
Clopidogrel and the main circulating metabolite bind reversibly ''in vitro'' to human plasma proteins (98% and 94%, respectively). The binding is not saturable ''in vitro'' up to a concentration of 110&nbsp;μg/ml.

*Metabolism and elimination: ''In vitro'' and ''in vivo'', clopidogrel undergoes rapid hydrolysis into its [[carboxylic acid]] derivative. In plasma and urine, the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is also observed.

=== Pharmacogenetics ===
CYP2C19 is an important drug-metabolizing enzyme that catalyzes the biotransformation of many clinically useful drugs, including antidepressants, barbiturates, proton pump inhibitors, and antimalarial and antitumor drugs. Clopidogrel is one of the drugs metabolized by this enzyme.

Several recent landmark studies have proven the importance of 2C19 genotyping in treatment using clopidogrel. In March 2010, the FDA put a black box warning on Plavix to make patients and healthcare providers aware that CYP2C19-poor metabolizers, representing up to 14% of patients, are at high risk of treatment failure and that testing is available.<ref name="FDA Black Box" /> Patients with variants in cytochrome P-450 2C19 (CYP2C19) have lower levels of the active metabolite of clopidogrel, less inhibition of platelets, and a 3.58-times greater risk for major adverse cardiovascular events such as death, heart attack, and stroke; the risk was greatest in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.pgxnews.org/web/the-news/1-latest-news/47-fda-updates-plavix-label-with-pgx-data | title=FDA updates Plavix label with PGx data | author=PGxNews.Org| publisher=PGxNews.Org| accessdate=2009-06-13|date=June 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

'''Ticlopidine''' (trade name '''Ticlid''') is an antiplatelet drug in the [[thienopyridine]] family which is an [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP) receptor inhibitor. Research initially showed that it was useful for preventing strokes and coronary stent occlusions. However, because of its rare but serious side effects of [[neutropenia]] and [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]] it was primarily used in patients in whom aspirin was not tolerated, or in whom dual antiplatelet therapy was desirable. With the advent of newer and safer antiplatelet drugs such as [[clopidogrel]] and [[ticagrelor]], its use remained limited.

== History ==
Ticlopidine was discovered incidentally in the 1970s while trying to develop a new anti-inflammatory medication. Pharmacology developers noted that this new compound had strong anti-platelet properties. In 1978 it began to be marketed in France for patients at high risk for thrombotic events: postoperative cardiac patients, patients undergoing hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease, and the prevention of strokes and ischemic heart disease.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|url = |title = The story of clopidogrel and its predecessor, ticlopidine: Could these major antiplatelet and antithrombotic drugs be discovered and developed today?|last = Maffrand, JP|date = 2012|journal = Comptes Rendus Chimie|volume=15|issue=8|pages=737–743|doi=10.1016/j.crci.2012.05.006}}</ref>

Ticlopidine was introduced to the United States under the trade name Ticlid by [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]] after it was FDA approved in 1991.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.Set_Current_Drug&ApplNo=019979&DrugName=TICLID&ActiveIngred=TICLOPIDINE%20HYDROCHLORIDE&SponsorApplicant=ROCHE%20PALO&ProductMktStatus=3&goto=Search.DrugDetails|title = Ticlid|date = |accessdate = 3 June 2015|website = Drugs@FDA|publisher = US Food & Drug Administration}}</ref> The first generic ticlopidine hydrochloride was FDA approved in 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.evaluategroup.com/Universal/View.aspx?type=Story&id=46390|title = Press release: Apotex First To Market Generic Version Of Ticlid®|date = July 6, 1999}}</ref>  As of April 2015, Roche, Caraco, Sandoz, Par, Major, Apotex, and Teva had discontinued generic ticlopidine and no ticlopidine preparations were available in the US.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.ashp.org/menu/DrugShortages/ResolvedShortages/Bulletin.aspx?Source=Resolved&Type=Rss&Id=661|title = Ticlopidine Tablets|date=April 1, 2015|accessdate = 3 June 2015|website = Resolved Shortages Bulletin|publisher = American Society of Health-System Pharmacists}}</ref>

== Medical uses ==
{{medref|section|date=June 2015}}
Ticlopidine is FDA approved for the prevention of strokes and, when combined with aspirin, for patients with a new coronary stent to prevent closure. There are also several off-label uses, including acute treatment of myocardial infarction and unstable angina, peripheral vascular disease, prevention of myocardial infarctions, diabetic retinopathy, and sickle cell disease.

=== Stroke ===
Ticlopidine is considered a second-line option for the prevention of thrombotic strokes among patients who have previously had a stroke or TIA. Studies have shown that it is superior to aspirin in the prevention of death or future strokes. However, it also has more frequent and serious side effects compared to aspirin, so it is reserved for those patients that cannot take aspirin.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = A randomized trial comparing ticlopidine hydrochloride with aspirin for the prevention of stroke in high-risk patients. Ticlopidine Aspirin Stroke Study Group|vauthors=Hass WK, Easton JD, Adams HP Jr, Pryse-Phillips W, Molony BA, Anderson S, Kamm B |date = 24 August 1989|journal = N Engl J Med|doi = 10.1056/nejm198908243210804|pmid = 2761587|access-date =|volume=321|pages=501–507}}</ref>

=== Heart disease ===
When a patient needs to have a stent placed in one of the vessels around their heart, it is important that that stent stay open to keep blood flowing to the heart. Therefore, patients with stents must take medications after the procedure to help maintain that blood flow. Ticlopidine, taken together with aspirin, is FDA approved for this purpose, and in studies it has been shown to work better than aspirin alone or aspirin with an anticoagulant.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = A randomized comparison of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy after the placement of coronary-artery stents|vauthors=Schomig L, Neumann FJ, Kastrati A |date = 1996|journal = N Engl J Med|doi = 10.1056/nejm199604253341702|pmid = 8598866|access-date = |display-authors=etal |volume=334 |pages=1084–1089}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = A clinical trial comparing three antithrombotic-drug regimens after coronary-artery stenting.

Current recommendations no longer recommend ticlopidine’s use.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = 2014 AHA/ACC Guideline for the Management of Patients With Non–ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes|last = American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines|date = 2014|journal = Circulation|volume=130|issue=25|pages=e344–426 |pmid =25249585|doi=10.1161/CIR.0000000000000134}}</ref>

==Research ==
Soon after its release, studies regarding ticlopidine found it had the potential to be helpful for other diseases including peripheral vascular disease,<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Antiaggregatory, physiological and clinical effects of ticlopidine in subjects with peripheral atherosclerosis|vauthors=Kirstein P, Jogestrand T, Johnsson H |date = 1980|journal = Atherosclerosis|doi = 10.1016/0021-9150(80)90240-3|pmid = |access-date = |display-authors=etal |volume=36 |pages=471–480}}</ref> diabetic retinopathy,<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Ticlopidine treatment reduces the progression of nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy|last = The TIMAD Study Group|date = 1990|journal = Arch Ophthalmol|doi = 10.1001/archopht.1990.01070130079035|pmid = |access-date =|volume=108|pages=1577}}</ref> and sickle cell disease.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Clinical and biological double-blind study of ticlopidine in preventive treatment of sickle cell disease crises|vauthors=Cabannes R, Lonsdorfer J, Castaigne JP |date = 1984|journal = Agents Actions|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |display-authors=etal}}</ref> However none had enough evidence for FDA approval. Due to the blood cell side effects associated with ticlopidine, researchers for treatments for these conditions have turned to other avenues.

== Adverse effects ==
The most serious side effects associated with ticlopidine are those that affect the blood cells, although these life-threatening complications are relatively rare. The most common side effects include:<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2001/19-979S018_Ticlid_prntlbl.pdf|title = Ticlid (ticlopidine) package insert|date = 2001|accessdate = |website = |publisher = US Food & Drug Administration|last = Roche Laboratories, Inc.}}</ref>
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Dyspepsia
* Rash
* Abdominal pain
Ticlopidine may also cause an increase in cholesterol, triglycerides, liver enzymes, and bleeding.<ref name=":1" />

=== Hematological ===
Use of ticlopidine has been associated with neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and aplastic anemia. Because of this risk, patients who are started on ticlopidine are typically monitored with blood tests to test their cell counts every two weeks for the first three months.<ref name=":1" />

== Contraindications ==
The use of ticlopidine is contraindicated in anyone with:
* Increased risk of bleeding (i.e. frequent falls, gastrointestinal bleeds)
* History of hematological disease
* Severe liver disease
* History of allergic reaction to ticlopidine or any thienopyridine drug such as clopidogrel
Because of the increased risk of bleeding, patients taking ticlopidine should discontinue the medication 10–14 days before surgery.<ref name=":1" />

== Pregnancy and lactation ==
Ticlopidine is a FDA pregnancy risk category B. There have been no studies done in humans. Studies in rats show that high drug levels could cause toxicity in both mother and fetus, but there are no known birth defects associated with its use.<ref name=":1" />

There have been no studies to test whether ticlopidine goes into breast milk. Studies in rats have shown that it is passed in rats’ milk.<ref name=":1" />

== Mechanism of action ==
Ticlopidine is a thienopyridine which, when metabolized by the body, irreversibly blocks the [[P2Y12]] component of the [[ADP receptor]] on the surface of platelets. Without ADP, fibrinogen does not bind to the platelet surface, preventing platelets from sticking to each other.<ref name=":1" /> By interfering with platelet function, ticlopidine prevents clots from forming on the inside of blood vessels.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Basic and Clinical Pharmacology, 12th ed.|vauthors=Katzung B, Masters S, Trevor A |publisher = |year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = Chapter 34: Drugs Used in Disorders of Coagulation}}</ref> Anti-platelet effects start within 2 days and reach their maximum by 6 days of therapy. Ticlopidine’s effects persist for 3 days after discontinuing ticlopidine although it may take 1–2 weeks for platelet function to return to normal, as the medication affects platelets irreversibly. Therefore, new platelets must be formed before platelet function normalizes.<ref name=":1" />

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Ticlopidine is ingested orally with 80% bioavailability with rapid absorption. Even higher absorption can occur if ticlopidine is taken with food. It is metabolized by the liver with both renal and fecal elimination. Clearance is nonlinear and varies with repeated dosing. After the first dose the half life is 12.6 hours, but with repeated dosing the maximum half life is 4–5 days. Clearance is also slower in the elderly. The drug is 98% reversibly bound to proteins.<ref name=":1" />

== Drug-drug interactions ==
Ticlopidine interacts with several classes of medications. It increases the antiplatelet effects of aspirin and other NSAIDs.<ref name=":1" /> Taking ticlopidine at the same time as antacids decreases the absorption of ticlopidine.<ref name=":1" /> Ticlopidine inhibits liver CYP2C19<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Ticlopidine as selective mechanism-based inhibitor of human cytochrome P450 2C19|last = Ha-Duong NT, Dijols S, Macherey, AC|date = 2001|journal = Biochemistry|doi = 10.1021/bi010254c|pmid = |access-date =|volume=40|pages=12112–12122}}</ref> and CYP2B6<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Effect of clopidogrel and ticlopidine on cytochrome P450 2B6 activity as measured by bupropion hydroxylation|vauthors=Turpeinen M, Tolonen A, Uusitalo J |date = 2005|journal = Clin Pharmacol Ther|doi = 10.1016/j.clpt.2005.02.010|pmid = |access-date = |display-authors=etal |volume=77 |pages=553–559}}</ref> and thus can affect blood levels of medications metabolized by these systems.

== Chemical properties ==
Ticlopidine's systemic name is 5-[(2-chlorophenyl)methyl]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-''c'']pyridine. Its molecular weight is 263.786 g/mol. It is a white crystalline solid. It is soluble in water and methanol and somewhat soluble in methylene chloride, ethanol, and acetone. It self buffers in water to a pH of 3.6.<ref name=":1" />

[[Hyperglycemia]] is also a common side effect.

The tendency, as for all loop diuretics, to cause low serum potassium concentration ([[hypokalemia]]) has given rise to combination products, either with potassium itself (e.g. Lasix-K and Diumide-K Continus) or with the [[potassium-sparing diuretic]] [[amiloride]] ([[Co-amilofruse]]).

==Mechanism of action==
{{Main article|Loop diuretic}}
Furosemide, like other loop diuretics, acts by inhibiting the luminal [[Na-K-Cl cotransporter]] in the [[thick ascending limb]] of the [[loop of Henle]], by binding to the chloride transport channel, thus causing sodium, chloride, and potassium loss in urine.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dowd|first1=Frank J|last2=Johnson|first2=Bart|last3=Mariotti|first3=Angelo|title=Pharmacology and Therapeutics for Dentistry - E-Book|date=3 September 2016|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780323445955|pages=324–326|url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=6xT7DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA326|accessdate=4 November 2017}}</ref>

The action on the distal tubules is independent of any inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase or aldosterone; it also abolishes the corticomedullary osmotic gradient and blocks negative, as well as positive, [[free water clearance]]. Because of the large NaCl absorptive capacity of the loop of Henle, diuresis is not limited by development of acidosis, as it is with the carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.

Additionally, furosemide is a noncompetitive subtype-specific blocker of GABA-A receptors.<ref name="Korpi95">{{cite journal |vauthors=Korpi ER, Kuner T, Seeburg PH, Lüddens H |title=Selective antagonist for the cerebellar granule cell-specific gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor |journal=Mol.

==Names==
Furosemide is the [[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]] and [[British Approved Name|BAN]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Namingofmedicines/ChangestomedicinesnamesBANstorINNs/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427025454/http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Namingofmedicines/ChangestomedicinesnamesBANstorINNs/index.htm |archivedate=2010-04-27 |df= }}</ref> The previous BAN was frusemide.

Some of the brand names under which furosemide is marketed include: Aisemide, Apo-Furosemide, Beronald, Desdemin, Discoid, Diural, Diurapid, Dryptal, Durafurid, Edemid, Errolon, Eutensin, Flusapex, Frudix, Frusetic, Frusid, Fulsix, Fuluvamide, Furesis, Furix, Furo-Puren, Furon, Furosedon, Fusid.frusone, Hydro-rapid, Impugan, Katlex, Lasilix, Lasix, Lodix, Lowpston, Macasirool, Mirfat, Nicorol, Odemase, Oedemex, Profemin, Rosemide, Rusyde, Salix, Seguril, Teva-Furosemide, Trofurit, Uremide, and Urex.

==Veterinary uses==
The diuretic effects are put to use most commonly in horses to prevent bleeding during a race. Sometime in the early 1970s, furosemide's ability to prevent, or at least greatly reduce, the incidence of bleeding ([[exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage]]) by horses during races was discovered accidentally.  In the United States of America, pursuant to the racing rules of most states, horses that bleed from the nostrils three times are permanently barred from racing. Clinical trials followed, and by decade's end, racing commissions in some states in the USA began legalizing its use on race horses.  On September 1, 1995, [[New York State|New York]] became the last state in the United States to approve such use, after years of refusing to consider doing so. Some states allow its use for all racehorses; some allow it only for confirmed "bleeders".  Its use for this purpose is still prohibited in many other countries.

Furosemide is also used in horses for pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure (in combination with other drugs), and allergic reactions.  Although it increases circulation to the kidneys, it does not help kidney function, and is not recommended for kidney disease.

It is also used to treat congestive heart failure (pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, and/or ascites) in cats and dogs.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kittleson |first1=Mark |authorlink1=Mark Kittleson |last2=Kienle |first2=Richard |authorlink2=Richar Kienle |date=1998 |title=Small Animal Cardiovascular Medicine |ISBN=978-0-8151-5140-1}}</ref> It can also be used in an attempt to promote urine production in anuric or oliguric acute renal failure.

===Precautions, side effects, and administration for horses===
Furosemide is injected either [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscularly]] or [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]], usually 0.5-1.0&nbsp;mg/kg twice/day, although less before a horse is raced. As with many diuretics, it can cause [[dehydration]] and [[electrolyte imbalance]], including loss of [[potassium]], [[calcium]], [[sodium]], and [[magnesium]]. Excessive use of furosemide will most likely lead to a [[metabolic alkalosis]] due to [[hypochloremia]] and [[hypokalemia]]. The drug should, therefore, not be used in horses that are dehydrated or experiencing kidney failure. It should be used with caution in horses with liver problems or electrolyte abnormalities. Overdose may lead to dehydration, change in drinking patterns and urination, seizures, gastrointestinal problems, kidney damage, lethargy, collapse, and coma.

Furosemide should be used with caution when combined with corticosteroids (as this increases the risk of electrolyte imbalance), aminoglycoside antibiotics (increases risk of kidney or ear damage), and trimethoprim sulfa (causes decreased platelet count). It may also cause interactions with anesthesics, so its use should be related to the veterinarian if the animal is going into surgery, and it decreases the kidneys' ability to excrete [[aspirin]], so dosages will need to be adjusted if combined with that drug.

Furosemide may increase the risk of [[digoxin]] toxicity due to hypokalemia.

The drug is best not used during pregnancy or in a lactating mare, as it has been shown to be passed through the placenta and milk in studies with other species. It should not be used in horses with [[pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction]] (Cushings).

Furosemide is detectable in urine 36–72 hours following injection. Its use is prohibited by most equestrian organizations.

{{Infobox sodium}}
'''Sodium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&nbsp;'''Na''' (from Latin ''natrium'') and [[atomic number]]&nbsp;11. It is a soft, silvery-white, highly reactive [[metal]]. Sodium is an [[alkali metal]], being in [[group 1 element|group 1]] of the periodic table, because it has a single electron in its outer shell that it readily donates, creating a positively charged ion—the Na<sup>+</sup> [[cation]]. Its only stable [[isotope]] is <sup>23</sup>Na. The free metal does not occur in nature, but must be prepared from compounds. Sodium is the [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|sixth most abundant element in the Earth's crust]], and exists in numerous [[minerals]] such as [[feldspar]]s, [[sodalite]], and [[halite|rock salt]] (NaCl). Many salts of sodium are highly water-soluble: sodium ions have been [[Leaching (chemistry)|leached]] by the action of water from the [[Earth|Earth's]] [[mineral]]s over eons, and thus sodium and [[chlorine]] are the most common dissolved elements by weight in the oceans.

Sodium was first isolated by [[Humphry Davy]] in 1807 by the [[electrolysis]] of [[sodium hydroxide]]. Among many other useful sodium compounds, [[sodium hydroxide]] ([[lye]]) is used in [[Soap|soap manufacture]], and [[sodium chloride]] ([[edible salt]]) is a [[De-ice|de-icing]] agent and a nutrient for animals including humans.

Sodium is an [[Dietary mineral|essential element]] for all animals and some plants. Sodium ions are the major cation in the [[extracellular fluid]] (ECF) and as such are the major contributor to the ECF [[osmotic pressure]] and ECF compartment volume. Loss of water from the ECF compartment increases the sodium concentration, a condition called [[hypernatremia]]. [[Tonicity|Isotonic]] loss of water and sodium from the ECF compartment decreases the size of that compartment in a condition called ECF [[hypovolemia]].

By means of the [[Na+/K+-ATPase|sodium-potassium pump]], living human cells pump three sodium ions out of the cell in exchange for two potassium ions pumped in; comparing ion concentrations across the cell membrane, inside to outside, [[potassium]] measures about 40:1, and sodium, about 1:10. In [[Neuron|nerve cells]], the electrical charge across the cell membrane enables transmission of the nerve impulse—an [[action potential]]—when the charge is dissipated; sodium plays a key role in that activity.

===Physical===
[[File:Na-D-sodium D-lines-589nm.jpg|thumb|left|[[Emission spectrum]] for sodium, showing the [[Fraunhofer lines|D line]].]]
Sodium at [[standard temperature and pressure]] is a soft silvery metal that combines with oxygen in air and forms grayish white [[sodium oxide]] unless immersed in oil or inert gas, which are the conditions it is usually stored in. Sodium metal can be easily cut with a knife and is a good conductor of electricity and heat because it has only one electron in its valence shell, resulting in weak [[metallic bonding]] and [[free electron]]s, which carry energy. Due to having low atomic mass and large atomic radius, sodium is third-least dense of all elemental metals and is one of only three metals that can float on water, the other two being lithium and potassium.<ref name=Greenwood75>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 75</ref> The melting (98&nbsp;°C) and boiling (883&nbsp;°C) points of sodium are lower than those of lithium but higher than those of the heavier alkali metals potassium, rubidium, and caesium, following periodic trends down the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/science-and-technology/chemistry/compounds-and-elements/alkali-metals|title="Alkali Metals." Science of Everyday Things|work=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> These properties change dramatically at elevated pressures: at 1.5 [[Bar (unit)|Mbar]], the color changes from silvery metallic to black; at 1.9 Mbar the material becomes transparent with a red color; and at 3 Mbar, sodium is a clear and transparent solid. All of these high-pressure [[allotrope]]s are insulators and [[electride]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gatti|first1=M.|last2=Tokatly|first2=I.|last3=Rubio|first3=A.|date=2010|title=Sodium: A Charge-Transfer Insulator at High Pressures|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=104|issue=21|page=216404|pmid=20867123|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.216404|bibcode=2010PhRvL.104u6404G|arxiv = 1003.0540 }}</ref>

Because of this and its low first [[ionization energy]] of 495.8 kJ/mol, the sodium atom is much more likely to lose the last electron and acquire a positive charge than to gain one and acquire a negative charge. This process requires so little energy that sodium is readily oxidized by giving up its 11th electron. In contrast, the second ionization energy is very high (4562 kJ/mol), because the 10th electron is closer to the nucleus than the 11th electron. As a result, sodium usually forms [[ionic compound]]s involving the Na<sup>+</sup> cation.<ref>{{cite book|title=Cambridge International AS and A Level Chemistry Coursebook|author=Lawrie Ryan|author2= Roger Norris|publisher=Cambridge University Press, 2014|edition=illustrated|isbn=1-107-63845-3|page=36}}</ref>

[[File:SodiumSterateChemStr.png|thumb|center|300px|Two equivalent images of the chemical structure of [[sodium stearate]], a typical soap.]]
Most [[soap]]s are sodium salts of [[fatty acid]]s.

Like all the [[alkali metal]]s, sodium reacts [[Exothermic reaction|exothermically]] with water, and sufficiently large pieces melt to a sphere and may explode.  The reaction produces caustic soda ([[sodium hydroxide]]) and flammable [[hydrogen]] gas. When burned in air, it forms primarily [[sodium peroxide]] with some [[sodium oxide]].<ref name=Greenwood84>Greenwoood and Earnshaw, p. 84</ref>

===Aqueous solutions===
Sodium tends to form water-soluble compounds, such as [[halides]], [[sulfate]]s, [[nitrates]], [[carboxylates]] and [[carbonate]]s. The main aqueous species are the aquo complexes [Na(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>''n''</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, where ''n'' = 4–8; with ''n'' = 6 indicated from X-ray diffraction data and computer simulations.<ref name=Lincoln>{{cite book|doi=10.1016/B0-08-043748-6/01055-0|title=Comprehensive Coordination Chemistry II|date=2004|isbn=978-0-08-043748-4|page=515|chapter=Metal Aqua Ions|last1=Lincoln|first1=S.

===Electrides and sodides===
Like the other alkali metals, sodium dissolves in ammonia and some amines to give deeply colored solutions; evaporation of these solutions leaves a shiny film of metallic sodium. The solutions contain the [[coordination complex]] (Na(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>)<sup>+</sup>, with the positive charge counterbalanced by [[electride|electrons as anions]]; [[cryptand]]s permit the isolation of these complexes as crystalline solids. Sodium forms complexes with crown ethers, cryptands and other ligands.<ref>{{cite book|title=Applications of the Newer Techniques of Analysis|editor=Ivor L.

===Organosodium compounds===
[[File:Monensin2.png|thumb|The structure of the complex of sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>, shown in yellow) and the antibiotic [[monensin]]-A.]]
Many organosodium compounds have been prepared. Because of the high polarity of the C-Na bonds, they behave like sources of [[carbanion]]s (salts with organic [[anion]]s). Some well known derivatives include [[sodium cyclopentadienide]] (NaC<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>) and trityl sodium ((C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>CNa).<ref>{{OrgSynth |first1=W.

===Intermetallic compounds===
Sodium forms alloys with many metals, such as potassium, [[calcium]], [[lead]], and the [[group 11 element|group 11]] and [[group 12 elements|12]] elements. Sodium and potassium form KNa<sub>2</sub> and [[NaK]]. NaK is 40–90% potassium and it is liquid at [[ambient temperature]]. It is an excellent thermal and electrical conductor. Sodium-calcium alloys are by-products of electrolytic production of sodium from binary salt mixture of NaCl-CaCl<sub>2</sub> and ternary mixture NaCl-CaCl<sub>2</sub>-BaCl<sub>2</sub>. Calcium is only partially [[miscible]] with sodium. In liquid state, sodium is completely miscible with lead. There are several methods to make sodium-lead alloys. One is to melt them together and another is to deposit sodium electrolytically on molten lead cathodes. NaPb<sub>3</sub>, NaPb, Na<sub>9</sub>Pb<sub>4</sub>, Na<sub>5</sub>Pb<sub>2</sub>, and Na<sub>15</sub>Pb<sub>4</sub> are some of the known sodium-lead alloys. Sodium also forms alloys with [[gold]] (NaAu<sub>2</sub>) and [[silver]] (NaAg<sub>2</sub>). Group 12 metals ([[zinc]], [[cadmium]] and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]) are known to make alloys with sodium. NaZn<sub>13</sub> and NaCd<sub>2</sub> are alloys of zinc and cadmium. Sodium and mercury form NaHg, NaHg<sub>4</sub>, NaHg<sub>2</sub>, Na<sub>3</sub>Hg<sub>2</sub>, and Na<sub>3</sub>Hg.<ref>{{cite book|title=Alloys: Preparation, Properties, Applications|last=Habashi|first=Fathi|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, 2008|isbn=3-527-61192-4|pages=278–280}}</ref>

==History==
Because of its importance in human metabolism, salt has long been an important commodity, as shown by the English word ''salary'', which derives from ''salarium'', the wafers of salt sometimes given to Roman soldiers along with their other wages. In medieval Europe, a compound of sodium with the Latin name of ''sodanum'' was used as a [[headache]] remedy. The name sodium is thought to originate from the Arabic ''suda'', meaning headache, as the headache-alleviating properties of sodium carbonate or soda were well known in early times.<ref name=newton>{{cite book|last=Newton|first=David E.|editor-last=Baker|editor-first=Lawrence W.|title=Chemical Elements|date=1999|isbn=978-0-7876-2847-5|oclc=39778687}}</ref>  Although sodium, sometimes called ''soda'', had long been recognized in compounds, the metal itself was not isolated until 1807 by [[Humphry Davy|Sir Humphry Davy]] through the [[electrolysis]] of [[sodium hydroxide]].<ref name=Davy1807>{{cite journal|first=Humphry|last=Davy|title=On some new phenomena of chemical changes produced by electricity, particularly the decomposition of the fixed alkalies, and the exhibition of the new substances which constitute their bases; and on the general nature of alkaline bodies|date=1808|volume=98|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|pages=1–44|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gpwEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA57|doi=10.1098/rstl.1808.0001}}</ref><ref name="weeks">{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ed009p1035|title=The discovery of the elements.

Sodium imparts an intense yellow color to flames. As early as 1860, [[Gustav Kirchhoff|Kirchhoff]] and [[Robert Bunsen|Bunsen]] noted the high sensitivity of a sodium flame test, and stated in [[Annalen der Physik|Annalen der Physik und Chemie]]:<ref name="bunsen1">{{cite journal|doi =10.1002/andp.18601860602| title=Chemische Analyse durch Spectralbeobachtungen|date=1860 |last1=Kirchhoff |first1=G.|last2=Bunsen|first2=R. |journal=Annalen der Physik und Chemie |volume=186|issue=6 |pages=161–189|bibcode=1860AnP...186..161K}}</ref>

<blockquote>In a corner of our 60&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup> room farthest away from the apparatus, we exploded 3&nbsp;mg. of sodium chlorate with milk sugar while observing the nonluminous flame before the slit. After a while, it glowed a bright yellow and showed a strong sodium line that disappeared only after 10 minutes. From the weight of the sodium salt and the volume of air in the room, we easily calculate that one part by weight of air could not contain more than 1/20 millionth weight of sodium.</blockquote>

==Occurrence==
The Earth's crust contains 2.27% sodium, making it the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|seventh most abundant element]] on Earth and the fifth most abundant metal, behind [[aluminium]], [[iron]], [[calcium]], and [[magnesium]] and ahead of potassium.<ref name=Greenwood69>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 69</ref> Sodium's estimated oceanic abundance is 1.08{{e|4}} milligrams per liter.<ref name = "abundancecrc">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kTnxSi2B2FcC|title=CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 84th Edition|last=Lide|first=David R.|date=2003-06-19|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-0484-2|series=[[CRC Handbook]]|at=14: Abundance of Elements in the Earth's Crust and in the Sea|language=en}}</ref> Because of its high reactivity, it is never found as a pure element. It is found in many different minerals, some very soluble, such as [[halite]] and [[natron]], others much less soluble, such as [[amphibole]] and [[zeolite]].  The insolubility of certain sodium minerals such as [[cryolite]] and [[feldspar]] arises from their polymeric anions, which in the case of feldspar is a polysilicate.

===Astronomical observations===
Atomic sodium has a very strong [[spectral line]] in the yellow-orange part of the spectrum (the same line as is used in [[Sodium-vapor lamp|sodium vapour street lights]]). This appears as an [[absorption line]] in many types of stars, including the [[Sun]]. The line was first studied in 1814 by [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] during his investigation of the lines in the solar spectrum, now known as the [[Fraunhofer lines]]. Fraunhofer named it the 'D line', although it is now known to actually be a group of closely spaced lines split by [[fine structure|fine]] and [[hyperfine structure]].<ref>{{cite web|title=D-lines {{!}} spectroscopy|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/D-lines|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=6 November 2017|language=en}}</ref>

The strength of the D line means it has been detected in many other astronomical environments. In stars, it is seen in any whose surfaces are cool enough for sodium to exist in atomic form (rather than ionised). This corresponds to stars of roughly [[F-type main sequence star|F-type]] and cooler. Many other stars appear to have a sodium absorption line, but this is actually caused by gas in the foreground [[interstellar medium]]. The two can be distinguished via high-resolution spectroscopy, because interstellar lines are much narrower than those broadened by [[stellar rotation]].<ref>{{cite journal|bibcode=1994ApJ...436..152W|doi=10.1086/174889|title=A high-resolution survey of interstellar NA I D1 lines|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=436|pages=152|year=1994|last1=Welty|first1=Daniel E|last2=Hobbs|first2=L.

Though metallic sodium has some important uses, the major applications for sodium use compounds; millions of tons of [[sodium chloride]], [[sodium hydroxide|hydroxide]], and [[sodium carbonate|carbonate]] are produced annually. Sodium chloride is extensively used for [[anti-icing]] and [[de-icing]] and as a preservative; [[sodium bicarbonate]] is mainly used for cooking. Along with potassium, many important medicines have sodium added to improve their [[bioavailability]]; though potassium is the better ion in most cases, sodium is chosen for its lower price and atomic weight.<ref>{{cite book|last=Remington|first=Joseph P.|title=Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy|date=2006|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-4673-1|pages=365–366|edition=21st|editor-last=Beringer|editor-first=Paul|oclc=60679584}}</ref> [[Sodium hydride]] is used as a base for various reactions (such as the [[aldol reaction]]) in organic chemistry, and as a reducing agent in inorganic chemistry.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wiberg|first1=Egon|last2=Wiberg|first2=Nils|last3=Holleman|first3=A.

Metallic sodium is used mainly for the production of [[sodium borohydride]], [[sodium azide]], [[indigo dye|indigo]], and [[triphenylphosphine]]. A once-common use was the making of [[tetraethyllead]] and titanium metal; because of the move away from TEL and new titanium production methods, the production of sodium declined after 1970.<ref name=Ullmann>Alfred Klemm, Gabriele Hartmann, Ludwig Lange, "Sodium and Sodium Alloys" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a24_277}}</ref> Sodium is also used as an alloying metal, an [[anti-scaling agent]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LI4KmKqca78C&pg=PA76|page=76|title=Metal cleaning: bibliographical abstracts, 1842–1951|last=Harris|first=Jay C.|date=1949|publisher=[[American Society for Testing and Materials]]|oclc=1848092}}</ref> and as a reducing agent for metals when other materials are ineffective.

== Medical uses ==

The original indication of chloramphenicol was in the treatment of [[typhoid]], but the now almost universal presence of multiple drug-resistant ''[[Salmonella typhi]]'' has meant it is seldom used for this indication except when the organism is known to be sensitive.  Chloramphenicol may be used as a second-line agent in the treatment of [[tetracycline]]-resistant [[cholera]].

It is useful in the treatment of brain abscesses due to mixed organisms or when the causative organism is not known.
Chloramphenicol is active against the three main bacterial causes of [[meningitis]]: ''[[Neisseria meningitidis]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''. In low-income countries, the WHO no longer recommends oily chloramphenicol as first-line to treat meningitis, but recognises it may be used with caution if there are no available alternatives.<ref name="WHOMeningitis>{{cite web|title=WHO meningitis epidemic guidelines Africa|url=http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/HSE_GAR_ERI_2010_4/en/|accessdate=29 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305134645/http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/HSE_GAR_ERI_2010_4/en/|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=}}</ref>

Chloramphenicol has been used in the U.S. in the initial [[empirical treatment]] of children with fever and a [[petechial rash]], when the [[differential diagnosis]] includes both ''Neisseria meningitidis'' [[sepsis]] and [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]], pending the results of diagnostic investigations.

Chloramphenicol is also effective against ''[[Enterococcus faecium]]'', which has led to its being considered for treatment of [[vancomycin-resistant enterococcus]].

In the context of preventing [[endophthalmitis]], a complication of [[cataract]] surgery, a 2017 systematic review found moderate evidence that using chloramphenicol eye drops in addition to an antibiotic injection ([[cefuroxime]] or [[penicillin]]) will likely lower the risk of endophthalmitis, compared to eye drops or antibiotic injections alone.<ref name="Gower">{{cite journal |vauthors = Gower EW, Lindsley K, Tulenko SE, Nanji AA, Leyngold I, McDonnell PJ |title= Perioperative antibiotics for prevention of acute endophthalmitis after cataract surgery |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume= 2|issue=2|pages= CD006364 |date=2017 |pmid= 28192644|pmc= 5375161 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD006364.pub3}}</ref>

===Spectrum===
Chloramphenicol has a broad spectrum of activity and has been effective in treating ocular infections caused by a number of bacteria including ''Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae'', and ''Escherichia coli''. It is not effective against ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''. The following susceptibility data represent the [[minimum inhibitory concentration]] for a few medically significant organisms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://antibiotics.toku-e.com/antimicrobial_507.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423055139/http://antibiotics.toku-e.com/antimicrobial_507.html |archivedate=2014-04-23 |df= }}</ref>
* ''Escherichia coli'':  0.015-10,000&nbsp;μg/ml
* ''Staphylococcus aureus'': {{nowrap|0.06 μg/ml - > 128 μg/ml}}
* ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'': 2-16&nbsp;μg/ml
Each of these concentrations is dependent upon the bacterial strain being targeted. Some strains of ''E. coli'', for example, show spontaneous emergence of chloramphenicol resistance.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Carone|first=BR|author2=Xu, T |author3=Murphy, KC |author4= Marinus, MG |title=High incidence of multiple antibiotic resistant cells in cultures of in enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.|journal=Mutation research|date=Jan 2014|volume=759|pages=1–8|pmid=24361397 |doi=10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2013.11.008|pmc=3913999}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=AM|author2=Patel, S |author3=Forsberg, KJ |author4=Wang, B |author5=Bentley, G |author6=Razia, Y |author7=Qin, X |author8=Tarr, PI |author9= Dantas, G |title=Pediatric fecal microbiota harbor diverse and novel antibiotic resistance genes|journal=PLoS ONE|date=2013|volume=8|issue=11|pages=e78822|pmid=24236055 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0078822 |pmc=3827270|bibcode=2013PLoSO...878822M}}</ref>

===Resistance===

Three mechanisms of [[Antibiotic resistance|resistance]] to chloramphenicol are known: reduced membrane permeability, mutation of the 50S ribosomal subunit, and elaboration of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.  It is easy to select for reduced membrane permeability to chloramphenicol ''in vitro'' by serial passage of bacteria, and this is the most common mechanism of low-level chloramphenicol resistance.  High-level resistance is conferred by the ''cat''-gene; this [[gene]] codes for an [[enzyme]] called [[chloramphenicol acetyltransferase]], which inactivates chloramphenicol by covalently linking one or two [[acetyl]] groups, derived from acetyl-S-coenzyme A, to the [[hydroxyl]] groups on the chloramphenicol molecule. The acetylation prevents chloramphenicol from binding to the ribosome.  Resistance-conferring mutations of the 50S ribosomal subunit are rare.

Chloramphenicol resistance may be carried on a plasmid that also codes for resistance to other drugs.  One example is the [[ACCoT]] plasmid (A=[[ampicillin]], C=chloramphenicol, Co=[[co-trimoxazole]], T=[[tetracycline]]), which mediates [[multiple drug resistance]] in typhoid (also called [[R factors]]).

As of 2014 some ''[[Enterococcus faecium]]'' and'' [[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' strains are resistant to chloramphenicol. Some ''[[Veillonella]]'' spp. and ''[[Staphylococcus capitis]]'' strains have also developed resistance to chloramphenicol to varying degrees.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chloramphenicol spectrum of bacterial susceptibility and Resistance|url=http://www.toku-e.com/Upload/Products/PDS/20120618001452.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211211304/http://www.toku-e.com/Upload/Products/PDS/20120618001452.pdf|archivedate=11 February 2014|df=}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==

===Aplastic anemia===

The most serious [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]] of chloramphenicol treatment is [[aplastic anaemia]]. This effect is rare and sometimes fatal. The risk of AA is high enough that alternatives should be strongly considered. Treatments are available but expensive. No way exists to predict who may or may not get this side effect.  The effect usually occurs weeks or months after treatment has been stopped, and a genetic predisposition may be involved.  It is not known whether monitoring the [[blood count]]s of patients can prevent the development of aplastic anaemia, but patients are recommended to have a baseline blood count with a repeat blood count every few days while on treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Hammett-Stabler, C. |author2=Johns, T. | title = Laboratory guidelines for monitoring of antimicrobial drugs | journal = Clinical Chemistry | volume = 44| issue = 5 | pages = 1129–1140 |date=May 1988 | pmid = 9590397 }}</ref> Chloramphenicol should be discontinued if the complete blood count drops.  The highest risk is with oral chloramphenicol (affecting 1 in 24,000–40,000)<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Wallerstein, R. |author2=Condit, P. |author3=Kasper, C. |author4=Brown, J. |author5=Morrison, F. | title = Statewide study of chloramphenicol therapy and fatal aplastic anemia | journal = JAMA | volume = 208 | issue = 11 | pages = 2045–2050 |date=June 1969 | pmid = 5818983 | doi = 10.1001/jama.208.11.2045 }}</ref> and the lowest risk occurs with eye drops (affecting less than one in 224,716 prescriptions).<ref name="Lancaster1998"/>

[[Thiamphenicol]], a related compound with a similar spectrum of activity, is available in Italy and China for human use, and has never been associated with aplastic anaemia.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  Thiamphenicol is available in the U.S. and Europe as a [[veterinary]] antibiotic, but is not approved for use in humans.

===Bone marrow suppression===
Chloramphenicol may cause [[bone marrow suppression]] during treatment; this is a direct toxic effect of the drug on human [[mitochondria]].<ref name="pmid2486534">{{cite journal |author=Yunis AA |title=Chloramphenicol toxicity: 25 years of research |journal=Am. J. Med. |volume=87 |issue=3N |pages=44N–48N |date=September 1989 |pmid=2486534 }}</ref> This effect manifests first as a fall in [[hemoglobin]] levels, which occurs quite predictably once a cumulative dose of 20 g has been given. The anaemia is fully reversible once the drug is stopped and does not predict future development of aplastic anaemia. Studies in mice have suggested existing marrow damage may compound any marrow damage resulting from the toxic effects of chloramphenicol.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morley|first=Alec|author2=Trainor, Kevin |author3=Remes, Judith |title=Residual Marrow Damage: Possible Explanation for Idiosyncrasy to Chloramphenicol|journal=British Journal of Haematology|date=1 April 1976|volume=32|issue=4|pages=525–532|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.1976.tb00955.x}}</ref>

===Leukemia===
Leukemia, a cancer of the blood or bone marrow, is characterized by an abnormal increase of immature white blood cells. The risk of childhood [[leukemia]] is increased, as demonstrated in a Chinese [[case-controlled study]],<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Shu, X. |author2=Gao, Y. |author3=Linet, M. |author4=Brinton, L. |author5=Gao, R. |author6=Jin, F. |author7=Fraumeni, J. | title = Chloramphenicol use and childhood leukaemia in Shanghai | journal = Lancet | volume = 2 | issue = 8565 | pages = 934–937 |date=October 1987 | pmid = 2889862 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(87)91420-6 }}</ref> and the risk increases with length of treatment.

===Gray baby syndrome===
Intravenous chloramphenicol use has been associated with the so-called [[gray baby syndrome]].<!--
  --><ref name=McIntyre_2004>{{cite journal |author1=McIntyre, J. |author2=Choonara, I. | title = Drug toxicity in the neonate | journal = Biology of the Neonate | volume = 86 | issue = 4 | pages = 218–221 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15249753 | doi = 10.1159/000079656 }}</ref>
This phenomenon occurs in newborn infants because they do not yet have fully functional liver enzymes (i.e. UDP-glucuronyl transferase), so chloramphenicol remains unmetabolized in the body.<!--
  --><ref name="Piñeiro-Carrero_2004">{{cite journal |author1=Piñeiro-Carrero, V. |author2=Piñeiro, E. | title = Liver | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 113 | issue = 4 Supplement | pages = 1097–1106 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15060205 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/Supplement_3/1097.full.pdf | format = pdf }}</ref>
This causes several adverse effects, including [[hypotension]] and [[cyanosis]]. The condition can be prevented by using the drug at the recommended doses, and monitoring blood levels.<!--

===Hypersensitivity reactions===
Fever, macular and vesicular rashes, angioedema, urticaria, and anaphylaxis may occur. Herxheimer’s reactions have occurred during therapy for typhoid fever.<ref name="Drug Insert from DailyMed">{{cite web|title=Drug Insert from DailyMed|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=08c16a42-1ad4-400f-b1b0-75303eb86713|accessdate=18 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419012007/http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=08c16a42-1ad4-400f-b1b0-75303eb86713|archivedate=19 April 2014|df=}}</ref>

===Neurotoxic reactions===
Headache, mild depression, mental confusion, and delirium have been described in patients receiving chloramphenicol. Optic and peripheral neuritis have been reported, usually following long-term therapy. If this occurs, the drug should be promptly withdrawn.<ref name="Drug Insert from DailyMed" />

==Pharmacokinetics==
Chloramphenicol is extremely lipid-soluble; it remains relatively [[plasma protein binding|unbound to protein]] and is a small molecule. It has a large apparent [[volume of distribution]] and penetrates effectively into all tissues of the body, including the brain.  Distribution is not uniform, with highest concentrations found in the liver and kidney, with lowest in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid.<ref name="Drug Insert from DailyMed" />  The concentration achieved in brain and [[cerebrospinal fluid]] <!-- (CSF) --> is around 30 to 50% of the overall average body concentration, even when the meninges are not inflamed; this increases to as high as 89% when the meninges are inflamed.

Chloramphenicol increases the absorption of [[Human iron metabolism|iron]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Pill Book, The | title = Iron Supplements | pages = 593–596 |editor1=Harold M. Silverman |editor2=Pharm.D. (-in-chief) | publisher = Bantam Dell | location = New York | edition = 12th revised | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-553-58892-7 }}</ref>

===Use in special populations===
Chloramphenicol is metabolized by the liver to chloramphenicol [[glucuronic acid|glucuronate]] (which is inactive).  In liver impairment, the dose of chloramphenicol must therefore be reduced. No standard dose reduction exists for chloramphenicol in liver impairment, and the dose should be adjusted according to measured plasma concentrations.

The majority of the chloramphenicol dose is excreted by the kidneys as the inactive metabolite, chloramphenicol glucuronate.  Only a tiny fraction of the chloramphenicol is excreted by the kidneys unchanged.  Plasma levels should be monitored in patients with renal impairment, but this is not mandatory.  Chloramphenicol succinate ester (an intravenous [[prodrug]] form) is readily excreted unchanged by the kidneys, more so than chloramphenicol base, and this is the major reason why levels of chloramphenicol in the blood are much lower when given intravenously than orally.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Chloramphenicol passes into [[breast milk]], so should therefore be avoided during breast feeding, if possible.<ref name=kidsgrowth>[http://www.kidsgrowth.org/resources/articledetail.cfm?id=471 kidsgrowth.org --> Drugs and Other Substances in Breast Milk] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070623011707/http://www.kidsgrowth.org/resources/articledetail.cfm?id=471 |date=2007-06-23 }} Retrieved on June 19, 2009</ref>

===Dose monitoring===
[[Blood plasma|Plasma]] levels of chloramphenicol must be monitored in neonates and patients with abnormal liver function.  Plasma levels should be monitored in all children under the age of four, the elderly, and patients with renal failure.
Because efficacy and toxicity of chloramphenicol are associated with a maximum serum concentration, peak levels (one hour after the intravenous dose is given) should be 10-20&nbsp;µg/ml with toxicity {{nowrap|> 40 µg/ml}}; trough levels (taken immediately before a dose) should be 5-10&nbsp;µg/ml.<ref name="Laboratory guidelines for monitoring of antimicrobial drugs">{{cite journal|last=Hammett-Stabler|first=C|author2=Johns, T.|title=Laboratory guidelines for monitoring of antimicrobial drugs|journal=Clinical Chemistry|date=May 1988|volume=44|issue=5|pages=1129–1140|pmid=9590397}}<!--|accessdate=17 April 2014--></ref><ref name="Lexicomp Online Database">{{cite web|title=Chloramphenicol (Lexi-Drugs)|url=http://online.lexi.com/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/patch_f/6582|work=Lexi-Comp Online|accessdate=18 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726053121/http://online.lexi.com/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/patch_f/6582|archivedate=26 July 2013|df=}}</ref>

Administration of chloramphenicol concomitantly with bone marrow depressant drugs is contraindicated, although concerns over aplastic anaemia associated with ocular chloramphenicol have largely been discounted.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051022000549/http://www.rpsgb.org.uk/pdfs/otcchlorampheneyedropsguid.pdf ] June 2005.

==Mechanism of action==

Chloramphenicol is a [[Bacteriostatic agent|bacteriostatic]] by [[protein synthesis inhibitor|inhibiting protein synthesis]].  It prevents [[protein synthesis|protein chain elongation]] by inhibiting the [[peptidyl transferase]] activity of the bacterial [[ribosome]].

== History ==
In 2007, the accumulation of reports associating aplastic anemia and blood dyscrasia with chloramphenicol eye drops lead to the classification of “probable human carcinogen” according to World Health Organization criteria, based on the known published case reports and the spontaneous reports submitted to the National Registry of Drug-Induced Ocular Side Effects.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Fraunfelder, F. |author2=Fraunfelder, F | title = Restricting Topical Ocular Chloramphenicol Eye Drop Use in the United States.

==Society and culture==

===Cost===
In many areas of the world an intravenous dose is about 0.40 to 1.90 USD.<ref name=ERC2015/> In the United States it costs about 3.60 USD per dose in oral tablet form at wholesale.

===Names===
Chloramphenicol is available as a generic worldwide under many brandnames<ref>Drugs.com [https://www.drugs.com/international/chloramphenicol.html drugs.com international listings for chloramphenicol] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711033900/http://www.drugs.com/international/chloramphenicol.html |date=2015-07-11 }} Page accessed July 9, 2015</ref> and also under various generic names in eastern Europe and Russia, including chlornitromycin, levomycetin, and chloromycetin; the racemate is known as synthomycetin.<ref name=levomyc-free-sovdict>{{cite book|title=The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition, 1970-1979|publisher=The Gale Group, Inc.|edition=3|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Levomycetin|accessdate=10 July 2015}}</ref>

===Formulations===
[[File:Sample of Chloramphenicol.jpg|thumb|Pure chloramphenicol]]
Chloramphenicol is available as a capsule or as a liquid. In some countries, it is sold as chloramphenicol [[palmitate]] [[ester]] (CPE). CPE is inactive, and is [[hydrolysis|hydrolysed]] to active chloramphenicol in the [[small intestine]]. No difference in [[bioavailability]] is noted between chloramphenicol and CPE.

Manufacture of oral chloramphenicol in the U.S. stopped in 1991, because the vast majority of chloramphenicol-associated cases of aplastic anaemia are associated with the oral preparation. No oral formulation of chloramphenicol is now available in the U.S.

In molecular biology, chloramphenicol is prepared in ethanol.

====Intravenous====
The [[intravenous]] (IV) preparation of chloramphenicol is the succinate ester, because pure chloramphenicol does not dissolve in water.  This creates a problem: Chloramphenicol succinate ester is an inactive [[prodrug]] and must first be hydrolysed to chloramphenicol; however, the hydrolysis process is often incomplete, and 30% of the dose is lost and removed in the urine.  Serum concentrations of IV chloramphenicol are only 70% of those achieved when chloramphenicol is given orally.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Glazko, A. J. |author2=Dill, W. A. |author3=Kinkel, A.

====Oily====
Oily chloramphenicol (or chloramphenicol oil suspension) is a long-acting preparation of chloramphenicol first introduced by Roussel in 1954; marketed as Tifomycine, it was originally used as a treatment for [[typhoid]].  Roussel stopped production of oily chloramphenicol in 1995; the [[International Dispensary Association]] has manufactured it since 1998, first in [[Malta]] and then in [[India]] from December 2004.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Lewis, R.

====Eye drops====
Chloramphenicol is still used occasionally in topical preparations ([[ointment]]s and [[eye drop]]s) for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis.  Isolated case reports of [[aplastic anaemia]] following use of chloramphenicol eyedrops exist, but the risk is estimated to be of the order of less than one in 224,716 prescriptions.<ref name="Lancaster1998">{{cite journal | author1 = Lancaster, T. | author2 = Stewart, A.

'''Acetoacetic acid''' (also diacetic acid) is the [[organic compound]] with the formula CH<sub><span style="font-size:100%;">3</span></sub>COCH<sub><span style="font-size:100%;">2</span></sub>COOH. It is the simplest beta-[[keto acid]] group, and like other members of this class, it is unstable.  The methyl and ethyl esters, which are quite stable, are produced on a large scale industrially as precursors to dyes. Acetoacetic acid is a [[weak acid]].<ref name=Ullmann/>

==Biochemistry==
Under typical physiological conditions, acetoacetic acid exists as its [[conjugate base]], '''acetoacetate'''.

Acetoacetate is produced in [[mitochondria]] of the [[liver]] from acetoacetyl [[Coenzyme A]] (CoA). First another [[acetyl]] group is added from [[acetyl CoA]] to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylgluteryl CoA, and then an acetyl CoA is lost from this yielding acetoacetate. The initial acetoacetate can come from the last cycle in the [[beta oxidation]] of a [[fatty acid]], or it can be synthesized from two acetyl CoA molecules, catalyzed by [[thiolase]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Lubert Stryer|author-link=Lubert Stryer|title=[[Biochemistry (Stryer)|Biochemistry]]|date=1981|page=393|edition=2nd}}</ref>

In mammals acetoacetate produced in the liver (along with the other two "[[ketone bodies]]") is released into the bloodstream as an energy source during periods of [[fasting]], exercise, or as a result of [[type 1 diabetes mellitus]].<ref name=stryer2>{{cite book |last1= Stryer |first1= Lubert | title=Biochemistry. | edition= Fourth |location= New York |publisher= W.H. Freeman and Company|publication-date= 1995 |pages= 510–515, 581–613, 775–778 |isbn= 0 7167 2009 4 }}</ref> First a CoA group is enzymatically transferred to it from [[succinyl CoA]], converting it back to acetoacetyl CoA. This is then broken into two acetyl CoA molecules by thiolase, and these then enter the [[citric acid cycle]]. Heart muscle and renal cortex prefer acetoacetate over glucose. The brain uses acetoacetate when glucose levels are low due to fasting or diabetes.<ref>Stryer 1981, p. 394.</ref>

== Synthesis and properties ==
Acetoacetic acid may be prepared by the hydrolysis of [[diketene]]. Its esters are produced analogously via an reaction between diketene and alcohols,<ref name=Ullmann>{{cite book|author=Franz Dietrich Klingler|author2=Wolfgang Ebertz|chapter=Oxocarboxylic Acids|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2005|publisher=Wiley-VCH|place=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a18_313}}</ref> and acetoacetic acid can be prepared by the hydrolysis of these species.<ref>{{cite journal

In general, acetoacetic acid is generated at 0&nbsp;°C and used in situ immediately.<ref>{{OrgSynth|last1=Reynolds|first1=George A.|last2=VanAllan|first2=J. A.|title=Methylglyoxal-ω-Phenylhydrazone|journal=Organic Syntheses|year=1952|volume=32|pages=84|prep=CV4P0633|collvol=4|collvolpages=633|doi=10.15227/orgsyn.032.0084}}</ref>  It decomposes at a moderate [[reaction rate|rate]] to [[acetone]] and [[carbon dioxide]]:
:CH<sub>3</sub>C(O)CH<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H  →  CH<sub>3</sub>C(O)CH<sub>3</sub>  +  CO<sub>2</sub>
The acid form has a [[half-life]] of 140 minutes at 37&nbsp;°C in water, whereas the basic form (the anion) has a half-life of 130 hours. That is, it reacts about 55 times more slowly.<ref>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1071/CH9671823 |author1=Hay, R. W. |author2=Bond, M. A. |year= 1967|title= Kinetics of decarboxilation of acetoacetic acid|journal= Aust. J. Chem.|volume = 20|issue=9|pages=1823–8}}</ref>
It is a [[weak acid]] (like most alkyl carboxylic acids), with a [[acid dissociation constant|pK<sub>a</sub>]] of 3.58.

Acetoacetic acid displays keto-enol [[tautomerisation]], with the enol form being partially stabilised by extended conjugation and intramolecular [[H-bonding]]. The equilibrium is strongly solvent depended; with the keto form dominating in polar solvents (98% in water) and the enol form accounting for 25-49% of material in non-polar solvents.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Grande|first1=Karen D.|last2=Rosenfeld|first2=Stuart M.|title=Tautomeric equilibriums in acetoacetic acid|journal=The Journal of Organic Chemistry|volume=45|issue=9|year=1980|pages=1626–1628|issn=0022-3263|doi=10.1021/jo01297a017}}</ref>

==Applications==
Acetoacetic esters are used for the [[acetoacetylation]] reaction, which is widely used in the production of [[arylide yellow]]s and [[diarylide]] dyes.<ref name=Ullmann/>  Although the esters can be used in this reaction, diketene also reacts with [[alcohol]]s and [[amine]]s to the corresponding acetoacetic acid derivatives in a process called '''acetoacetylation'''. An example is the reaction with [[indane|2-aminoindane]]:<ref>{{cite journal | title = Knorr Cyclizations and Distonic Superelectrophiles |author1=Kiran Kumar Solingapuram Sai |author2=Thomas M.

'''Hydrogen''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''H''' and [[atomic number]]&nbsp;1. With a [[standard atomic weight]] of {{val|1.008}}, hydrogen is the lightest element on the [[periodic table]]. Its [[monatomic]] form (H) is the [[abundance of the chemical elements|most abundant]] chemical substance in the [[Universe]], constituting roughly 75% of all [[baryon]]ic mass.<ref>

The most common [[isotope]] of hydrogen, termed ''protium'' (name rarely used, symbol <sup>1</sup>H), has one [[proton]] and no [[neutron]]s.

The universal emergence of atomic hydrogen first occurred during the [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination epoch]]. At [[standard temperature and pressure]], hydrogen is a [[Transparency (optics)|colorless]], [[odorless]], [[taste]]less, non-toxic, [[nonmetal]]lic, highly [[combustion|combustible]] [[Diatomic molecule|diatomic]] [[gas]] with the [[molecular formula]] H<sub>2</sub>. Since hydrogen readily forms [[covalent bond|covalent]] compounds with most nonmetallic elements, most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in [[Molecular geometry|molecular forms]] such as [[water]] or [[organic compound]]s. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in [[acid–base reaction]]s because most acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In [[ionic compound]]s, hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge (i.e., [[anion]]) when it is known as a [[hydride]], or as a positively charged (i.e., [[cation]]) [[chemical species|species]] denoted by the symbol H<sup>+</sup>.

The energy levels of hydrogen can be calculated fairly accurately using the [[Bohr model]] of the atom, which conceptualizes the electron as "orbiting" the proton in analogy to the Earth's orbit of the Sun. However, the atomic electron and proton are held together by [[electromagnetic force]], while planets and celestial objects are held by [[gravity]]. Because of the discretization of [[angular momentum]] postulated in early [[quantum mechanics]] by Bohr, the electron in the Bohr model can only occupy certain allowed distances from the proton, and therefore only certain allowed energies.<ref>{{cite web

Hydrogen forms a vast array of compounds with [[carbon]] called the [[hydrocarbon]]s, and an even vaster array with [[heteroatoms]] that, because of their general association with living things, are called [[organic compound]]s.<ref name="hydrocarbon">{{cite web| title=Structure and Nomenclature of Hydrocarbons|publisher=Purdue University| url=http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/topicreview/bp/1organic/organic.html| accessdate=23 March 2008}}</ref> The study of their properties is known as [[organic chemistry]]<ref>{{cite web| title=Organic Chemistry| work=Dictionary.com| publisher=Lexico Publishing Group| date=2008| url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/organic%20chemistry| accessdate=23 March 2008}}</ref> and their study in the context of living [[organism]]s is known as [[biochemistry]].<ref>{{cite web

|accessdate=23 March 2008}}</ref> By some definitions, "organic" compounds are only required to contain carbon. However, most of them also contain hydrogen, and because it is the carbon-hydrogen bond which gives this class of compounds most of its particular chemical characteristics, carbon-hydrogen bonds are required in some definitions of the word "organic" in chemistry.<ref name="hydrocarbon" /> Millions of [[hydrocarbon]]s are known, and they are usually formed by complicated synthetic pathways that seldom involve elementary hydrogen.

====Hydrides====
{{Main article|Hydride}}
Compounds of hydrogen are often called [[hydride]]s, a term that is used fairly loosely. The term "hydride" suggests that the H atom has acquired a negative or anionic character, denoted H<sup>−</sup>, and is used when hydrogen forms a compound with a more [[electropositive]] element. The existence of the [[hydride|hydride anion]], suggested by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] in 1916 for group 1 and 2 salt-like hydrides, was demonstrated by Moers in 1920 by the electrolysis of molten [[lithium hydride]] (LiH), producing a [[stoichiometric|stoichiometry]] quantity of hydrogen at the anode.<ref name="Moers">{{cite journal
|last=Moers|first=K.

|date=1920|volume=113|issue=191|pages=179–228|doi=10.1002/zaac.19201130116
}}</ref> For hydrides other than group 1 and 2 metals, the term is quite misleading, considering the low electronegativity of hydrogen. An exception in group 2 hydrides is {{chem|BeH|2}}, which is polymeric. In [[lithium aluminium hydride]], the {{chem|AlH|4|-}} anion carries hydridic centers firmly attached to the Al(III).

Although hydrides can be formed with almost all main-group elements, the number and combination of possible compounds varies widely; for example, more than 100 binary borane hydrides are known, but only one binary aluminium hydride.<ref name="Downs">{{cite journal

In [[inorganic chemistry]], hydrides can also serve as [[bridging ligand]]s that link two metal centers in a [[coordination complex]]. This function is particularly common in [[group 13 element]]s, especially in [[borane]]s ([[boron]] hydrides) and [[aluminium]] complexes, as well as in clustered [[carborane]]s.<ref name="Miessler" />

====Protons and acids====
{{Further information|Acid–base reaction}}
Oxidation of hydrogen removes its electron and gives [[Hydrogen ion|H<sup>+</sup>]], which contains no electrons and a [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] which is usually composed of one proton. That is why {{chem|H|+}} is often called a proton. This species is central to discussion of [[acid]]s. Under the [[Bronsted-Lowry theory]], acids are proton donors, while bases are proton acceptors.

A bare proton, {{chem|H|+}}, cannot exist in solution or in ionic crystals because of its unstoppable attraction to other atoms or molecules with electrons. Except at the high temperatures associated with plasmas, such protons cannot be removed from the [[electron cloud]]s of atoms and molecules, and will remain attached to them. However, the term 'proton' is sometimes used loosely and metaphorically to refer to positively charged or [[cation]]ic hydrogen attached to other species in this fashion, and as such is denoted "{{chem|H|+}}" without any implication that any single protons exist freely as a species.

To avoid the implication of the naked "solvated proton" in solution, acidic aqueous solutions are sometimes considered to contain a less unlikely fictitious species, termed the "[[hydronium]] ion" ({{chem|H|3|O|+}}). However, even in this case, such solvated hydrogen cations are more realistically conceived as being organized into clusters that form species closer to H{{su|b=9}}{{chem|O|4|+}}.<ref name="Okumura">{{cite journal

Hydrogen is the only element that has different names for its isotopes in common use today. During the early study of radioactivity, various heavy radioactive isotopes were given their own names, but such names are no longer used, except for deuterium and tritium. The symbols D and T (instead of {{chem|2|H}} and {{chem|3|H}}) are sometimes used for deuterium and tritium, but the corresponding symbol for protium, P, is already in use for [[phosphorus]] and thus is not available for protium.<ref>{{cite web

[[File:Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier (by Louis Jean Desire Delaistre)RENEW.jpg|thumb|180px|Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier]]
Lavoisier produced hydrogen for his experiments on mass conservation by reacting a flux of steam with metallic [[iron]] through an incandescent iron tube heated in a fire. Anaerobic oxidation of iron by the protons of water at high temperature can be schematically represented by the set of following reactions:

:&nbsp;&nbsp; Fe + &nbsp;&nbsp; H<sub>2</sub>O → FeO + H<sub>2</sub>

:2 Fe + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O → Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>

:3 Fe + 4 H<sub>2</sub>O → Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + 4 H<sub>2</sub>

Many metals such as [[zirconium]] undergo a similar reaction with water leading to the production of hydrogen.

Hydrogen was [[Liquid hydrogen|liquefied]] for the first time by [[James Dewar]] in 1898 by using [[regenerative cooling]] and his invention, the [[vacuum flask]].<ref name="nbb" /> He produced [[solid hydrogen]] the next year.<ref name="nbb" /> [[Deuterium]] was discovered in December 1931 by [[Harold Urey]], and [[tritium]] was prepared in 1934 by [[Ernest Rutherford]], [[Mark Oliphant]], and [[Paul Harteck]].<ref name="Nostrand" /> [[Heavy water]], which consists of deuterium in the place of regular hydrogen, was discovered by Urey's group in 1932.<ref name="nbb" /> [[François Isaac de Rivaz]] built the first [[de Rivaz engine]], an internal combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806. [[Edward Daniel Clarke]] invented the hydrogen gas blowpipe in 1819. The [[Döbereiner's lamp]] and [[limelight]] were invented in 1823.<ref name="nbb" />

The first hydrogen-filled [[balloon]] was invented by [[Jacques Charles]] in 1783.<ref name="nbb" /> Hydrogen provided the lift for the first reliable form of air-travel following the 1852 invention of the first hydrogen-lifted airship by [[Henri Giffard]].<ref name="nbb" /> German count [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin]] promoted the idea of rigid airships lifted by hydrogen that later were called [[Zeppelin]]s; the first of which had its maiden flight in 1900.<ref name="nbb" /> Regularly scheduled flights started in 1910 and by the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, they had carried 35,000 passengers without a serious incident. Hydrogen-lifted airships were used as observation platforms and bombers during the war.

The first non-stop transatlantic crossing was made by the British airship ''[[R34 (airship)|R34]]'' in 1919. Regular passenger service resumed in the 1920s and the discovery of [[helium]] reserves in the United States promised increased safety, but the U.S. government refused to sell the gas for this purpose. Therefore, H<sub>2</sub> was used in the [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|''Hindenburg'']] airship, which was destroyed in a midair fire over [[New Jersey]] on 6 May 1937.<ref name="nbb" /> The incident was broadcast live on radio and filmed. Ignition of leaking hydrogen is widely assumed to be the cause, but later investigations pointed to the ignition of the [[aluminium|aluminized]] fabric coating by [[static electricity]]. But the damage to hydrogen's reputation as a [[lifting gas]] was already done and commercial hydrogen airship travel [[Rigid airship#Demise|ceased]].  Hydrogen is still used, in preference to non-flammable but more expensive helium, as a lifting gas for [[Weather balloon#Materials and equipment|weather balloons]].

In the same year the first [[hydrogen-cooled turbogenerator]] went into service with gaseous hydrogen as a [[coolant]] in the rotor and the stator in 1937 at [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], Ohio, by the Dayton Power & Light Co.;<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/chronologicalhis00natirich/chronologicalhis00natirich_djvu.txt|title=A chronological history of electrical development from 600 B.C|author=National Electrical Manufacturers Association|year=1946|page=102}}</ref> because of the thermal conductivity of hydrogen gas, this is the most common type in its field today.

One of the first quantum effects to be explicitly noticed (but not understood at the time) was a Maxwell observation involving hydrogen, half a century before full [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical theory]] arrived. Maxwell observed that the [[specific heat capacity]] of H<sub>2</sub> unaccountably departs from that of a [[diatomic]] gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures. According to quantum theory, this behavior arises from the spacing of the (quantized) rotational energy levels, which are particularly wide-spaced in H<sub>2</sub> because of its low mass. These widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures. Diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect.<ref name="Berman">{{cite journal

Throughout the universe, hydrogen is mostly found in the [[atom]]ic and [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] states, with properties quite different from those of molecular hydrogen. As a plasma, hydrogen's electron and proton are not bound together, resulting in very high electrical conductivity and high emissivity (producing the light from the Sun and other stars). The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the [[solar wind]] they interact with the Earth's [[magnetosphere]] giving rise to [[Birkeland current]]s and the [[Aurora (phenomenon)|aurora]]. Hydrogen is found in the neutral atomic state in the [[interstellar medium]]. The large amount of neutral hydrogen found in the damped Lyman-alpha systems is thought to dominate the cosmological baryonic density of the Universe up to [[redshift]] ''z''=4.<ref>{{cite journal

Under ordinary conditions on Earth, elemental hydrogen exists as the diatomic gas, H<sub>2</sub>. However, hydrogen gas is very rare in the Earth's atmosphere (1 [[part per million|ppm]] by volume) because of its light weight, which enables it to [[atmospheric escape|escape from Earth's gravity]] more easily than heavier gases. However, hydrogen is the third most abundant element on the Earth's surface,<ref name="ArgonneBasic">{{cite web

A molecular form called [[protonated molecular hydrogen]] ({{chem|H|3|+}}) is found in the interstellar medium, where it is generated by ionization of molecular hydrogen from [[cosmic ray]]s. This charged ion has also been observed in the upper atmosphere of the planet [[Jupiter]]. The ion is relatively stable in the environment of outer space due to the low temperature and density. {{chem|H|3|+}} is one of the most abundant ions in the Universe, and it plays a notable role in the chemistry of the interstellar medium.<ref>{{cite web|author=McCall Group|author2=Oka Group|date=22 April 2005|url=http://h3plus.uiuc.edu/|title=H3+ Resource Center|publisher=Universities of Illinois and Chicago|accessdate=5 February 2008}}</ref> Neutral [[triatomic hydrogen]] H<sub>3</sub> can exist only in an excited form and is unstable.<ref name=couple>{{cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-0083-4_27|title=Coupling of Bound States to Continuum States in Neutral Triatomic Hydrogen|year=2003|publisher=Department of Molecular and Optical Physics, University of Freiburg, Germany|author=Helm, H.|display-authors=etal}}</ref> By contrast, the positive [[hydrogen molecular ion]] ({{chem|H|2|+}}) is a rare molecule in the universe.

== Production ==
{{main article|Hydrogen production}}

{{chem|H|2}} is produced in chemistry and biology laboratories, often as a by-product of other reactions; in industry for the [[hydrogenation]] of [[Saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] substrates; and in nature as a means of expelling [[redox|reducing]] equivalents in biochemical reactions.

=== Steam reforming ===

Hydrogen can be prepared in several different ways, but economically the most important processes involve removal of hydrogen from hydrocarbons, as about 95% of hydrogen production came from steam reforming around year 2000.<ref name="Ogden 1999">{{cite journal |last=Ogden |first=J. M. |title=Prospects for building a hydrogen energy infrastructure |journal=Annual Review of Energy and the Environment |year=1999 |volume=24 |pages=227–279 |doi=10.1146/annurev.energy.24.1.227}}</ref><!--update?--> Commercial bulk hydrogen is usually produced by the [[steam reforming]] of [[natural gas]].<ref name="Oxtoby">{{cite book
| first=D. W.|last=Oxtoby|date=2002
| title=Principles of Modern Chemistry
| edition=5th|publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole
| isbn=0-03-035373-4}}</ref> At high temperatures (1000–1400&nbsp;K, 700–1100&nbsp;°C or 1300–2000&nbsp;°F), steam (water vapor) reacts with [[methane]] to yield [[carbon monoxide]] and {{chem|H|2}}.

: {{chem|CH|4}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} → CO + 3 {{chem|H|2}}

This reaction is favored at low pressures but is nonetheless conducted at high pressures (2.0 &nbsp;MPa, 20&nbsp;atm or 600&nbsp;[[inHg]]). This is because high-pressure {{chem|H|2}} is the most marketable product and [[pressure swing adsorption]] (PSA) purification systems work better at higher pressures. The product mixture is known as "[[synthesis gas]]" because it is often used directly for the production of [[methanol]] and related compounds. [[Hydrocarbon]]s other than methane can be used to produce synthesis gas with varying product ratios. One of the many complications to this highly optimized technology is the formation of coke or carbon:

: {{chem|CH|4}} → C + 2 {{chem|H|2}}

Consequently, steam reforming typically employs an excess of {{chem|H|2|O}}. Additional hydrogen can be recovered from the steam by use of carbon monoxide through the [[water gas shift reaction]], especially with an [[iron oxide]] catalyst. This reaction is also a common industrial source of [[carbon dioxide]]:<ref name="Oxtoby" />

: CO + {{chem|H|2|O}} → {{chem|CO|2}} + {{chem|H|2}}

Other important methods for {{chem|H|2}} production include partial oxidation of hydrocarbons:<ref>{{cite web| title=Hydrogen Properties, Uses, Applications| publisher=Universal Industrial Gases, Inc.| date=2007| url=http://www.uigi.com/hydrogen.html| accessdate=11 March 2008}}</ref>

: 2 {{chem|CH|4}} + {{chem|O|2}} → 2 CO + 4 {{chem|H|2}}

and the coal reaction, which can serve as a prelude to the shift reaction above:<ref name="Oxtoby" />

: C + {{chem|H|2|O}} → CO + {{chem|H|2}}

Hydrogen is sometimes produced and consumed in the same industrial process, without being separated. In the [[Haber process]] for the [[Ammonia production|production of ammonia]], hydrogen is generated from natural gas.<ref>{{cite web| last=Funderburg| first=E.| title=Why Are Nitrogen Prices So High?| publisher=The Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation| date=2008| url=http://www.noble.org/Ag/Soils/NitrogenPrices/Index.htm| accessdate=11 March 2008| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010509065844/http://www.noble.org/ag/Soils/NitrogenPrices/Index.htm| archivedate=9 May 2001| df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Electrolysis]] of [[brine]] to yield [[chlorine]] also produces hydrogen as a co-product.<ref>{{cite web| last=Lees| first=A.| title=Chemicals from salt| publisher=BBC|date=2007|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/chemistry/usefulproductsrocks/chemicals_saltrev3.shtml|accessdate=11 March 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071026052022/http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/chemistry/usefulproductsrocks/chemicals_saltrev3.shtml |archivedate = 26 October 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

=== Metal-acid ===

In the [[laboratory]], {{chem|H|2}} is usually prepared by the reaction of dilute [[oxidizing acid|non-oxidizing acids]] on some reactive metals such as [[zinc]] with [[Kipp's apparatus]].

: Zn + 2 {{chem|H|+}} → {{chem|Zn|2+}} + {{chem|H|2}}

[[Aluminium]] can also produce {{chem|H|2}} upon treatment with bases:

: 2 Al + 6 {{chem|H|2|O}} + 2 {{chem|OH|-}} → 2 {{chem|Al(OH)|4|-}} + 3 {{chem|H|2}}

The [[electrolysis of water]] is a simple method of producing hydrogen. A low voltage current is run through the water, and gaseous oxygen forms at the [[anode]] while gaseous hydrogen forms at the [[cathode]]. Typically the cathode is made from platinum or another inert metal when producing hydrogen for storage. If, however, the gas is to be burnt on site, oxygen is desirable to assist the combustion, and so both electrodes would be made from inert metals. (Iron, for instance, would oxidize, and thus decrease the amount of oxygen given off.) The theoretical maximum efficiency (electricity used vs. energetic value of hydrogen produced) is in the range 80–94%.<ref>{{cite web

An alloy of aluminium and [[gallium]] in pellet form added to water can be used to generate hydrogen. The process also produces [[alumina]], but the expensive gallium, which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used. This has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy, as hydrogen can be produced on-site and does not need to be transported.<ref>{{cite web| last=Venere|first=E.|date=15 May 2007| url=http://news.uns.purdue.edu/x/2007a/070515WoodallHydrogen.html| title=New process generates hydrogen from aluminum alloy to run engines, fuel cells| publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=5 February 2008}}</ref>

=== Thermochemical ===

There are more than 200 thermochemical cycles which can be used for [[water splitting]], around a dozen of these cycles such as the [[iron oxide cycle]], [[cerium(IV) oxide–cerium(III) oxide cycle]], [[zinc zinc-oxide cycle]], [[sulfur-iodine cycle]], [[copper-chlorine cycle]] and [[hybrid sulfur cycle]] are under research and in testing phase to produce hydrogen and oxygen from water and heat without using electricity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review05/pd28_weimer.pdf|title=Development of solar-powered thermochemical production of hydrogen from water|format=PDF|first1=Al|last1=Weimer|date=25 May 2005|publisher=Solar Thermochemical Hydrogen Generation Project}}</ref> A number of laboratories (including in France, Germany, Greece, Japan, and the USA) are developing thermochemical methods to produce hydrogen from solar energy and water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/progress07/ii_f_1_perret.pdf|title=Development of Solar-Powered Thermochemical Production of Hydrogen from Water, DOE Hydrogen Program, 2007|author=Perret, R.|accessdate=17 May 2008|format=PDF}}</ref>

=== Anaerobic corrosion ===

Under anaerobic conditions, [[iron]] and [[steel alloy]]s are slowly oxidized by the protons of water concomitantly reduced in molecular hydrogen ({{chem|H|2}}). The [[anaerobic corrosion]] of iron leads first to the formation of [[ferrous hydroxide]] (green rust) and can be described by the following reaction:

: Fe + 2 {{chem|H|2}}O → {{chem|Fe(OH)|2}} + {{chem|H|2}}

In its turn, under anaerobic conditions, the [[ferrous hydroxide]] ({{chem|Fe(OH)|2}} ) can be oxidized by the protons of water to form [[magnetite]] and molecular hydrogen.
This process is described by the [[Schikorr reaction]]:

: 3 {{chem|Fe(OH)|2}} → {{chem|Fe|3|O|4|}} + 2 {{chem|H|2}}O + {{chem|H|2}}
: ''ferrous hydroxide → magnetite + water + hydrogen''

The well crystallized magnetite ({{chem|Fe|3|O|4|}}) is thermodynamically more stable than the ferrous hydroxide ({{chem|Fe(OH)|2}} ).

This process occurs during the anaerobic corrosion of [[iron]] and [[steel]] in [[Anoxic waters|oxygen-free]] [[groundwater]] and in reducing [[soil]]s below the [[water table]].

=== Geological occurrence: the serpentinization reaction ===

In the absence of atmospheric oxygen ({{chem|O|2}}), in deep geological conditions prevailing far away from Earth atmosphere, hydrogen ({{chem|H|2}}) is produced during the process of [[Serpentinization#Hydrogen production by anaerobic oxidation of fayalite ferrous ions|serpentinization]] by the anaerobic oxidation by the water protons (H<sup>+</sup>) of the ferrous (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) silicate present in the crystal lattice of the [[fayalite]] ({{chem|Fe|2|SiO|4}}, the [[olivine]] iron-endmember). The corresponding reaction leading to the formation of [[magnetite]] ({{chem|Fe|3|O|4|}}), [[quartz]] (Si{{chem|O|2}}) and hydrogen ({{chem|H|2}}) is the following:

: 3{{chem|Fe|2|SiO|4}} + 2 {{chem|H|2}}O → 2 {{chem|Fe|3|O|4|}} + 3 Si{{chem|O|2}} + 3 {{chem|H|2}}
: ''fayalite + water → magnetite + quartz + hydrogen''

This reaction closely resembles the [[Schikorr reaction]] observed in the anaerobic oxidation of the [[ferrous hydroxide]] in contact with water.

=== Formation in transformers ===

From all the fault gases formed in power [[transformer]]s, hydrogen is the most common and is generated under most fault conditions; thus, formation of hydrogen is an early indication of serious problems in the transformer's life cycle.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hirschler, M. M.|title=Electrical Insulating Materials: International Issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bmxcV_TlsV8C&pg=PA89|accessdate=13 July 2012|date=2000|publisher=ASTM International|isbn=978-0-8031-2613-8|pages=89–}}</ref>

==Applications==

===Consumption in processes===
Large quantities of {{chem|H|2}} are needed in the petroleum and chemical industries. The largest application of {{chem|H|2}} is for the processing ("upgrading") of fossil fuels, and in the production of [[ammonia]]. The key consumers of {{chem|H|2}} in the petrochemical plant include [[hydrodealkylation]], [[hydrodesulfurization]], and [[hydrocracking]]. {{chem|H|2}} has several other important uses. {{chem|H|2}} is used as a hydrogenating agent, particularly in increasing the level of saturation of unsaturated fats and [[Vegetable oil|oils]] (found in items such as margarine), and in the production of [[methanol]]. It is similarly the source of hydrogen in the manufacture of [[hydrochloric acid]]. {{chem|H|2}} is also used as a [[reducing agent]] of metallic [[ore]]s.<ref>{{cite web

H<sub>2</sub> is a product of some types of [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|anaerobic metabolism]] and is produced by several [[microorganism]]s, usually via reactions [[catalysis|catalyzed]] by [[iron]]- or [[nickel]]-containing [[enzyme]]s called [[hydrogenase]]s. These enzymes catalyze the reversible [[redox]] reaction between H<sub>2</sub> and its component two protons and two electrons.

Even interpreting the hydrogen data (including safety data) is confounded by a number of phenomena. Many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen depend on the [[Spin isomers of hydrogen|parahydrogen/orthohydrogen]] ratio (it often takes days or weeks at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio, for which the data is usually given). Hydrogen detonation parameters, such as critical detonation pressure and temperature, strongly depend on the container geometry.<ref name=NASAH2/>

'''Bromodeoxyuridine''' ('''5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine''', '''BrdU''', '''BUdR''', '''BrdUrd''', '''broxuridine''') is a synthetic [[nucleoside]] that is an [[structural analog|analog]] of [[thymidine]].

BrdU can be incorporated into the newly synthesized [[DNA]] of replicating cells (during the [[S phase]] of the [[cell cycle]] during which DNA is replicated), substituting for [[thymidine]] during [[DNA replication]]. [[Antibody|Antibodies]] specific for BrdU can then be used to detect the incorporated chemical (see [[immunohistochemistry]]), thus indicating cells that were actively replicating their DNA.

BrdU differs from [[thymidine]] in that BrdU substitutes a [[bromine]] atom for [[thymidine|thymidine's]] CH<sub>3</sub> group.  The Br substitution can be used in X-ray diffraction experiments in crystals containing either DNA or RNA.  The Br atom acts as an anomalous scatterer and its larger size will affect the crystal's X-ray diffraction enough to detect [[Isomorphism (crystallography)|isomorphous]] differences as well.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=24–34 |doi=10.1107/S0909049595013288 |title=MAD Phasing Strategies Explored with a Brominated Oligonucleotide Crystal at 1.65Å Resolution |year=1996 |last1=Peterson |first1=M.

However, it is not certain whether all microbes present in an environmental sample can incorporate BrdU into their biomass during ''de novo'' DNA synthesis. Therefore, a group of microorganisms may respond to a C source but go undetected using this technique. Additionally, this technique is biased towards identifying microorganisms with A- and T-rich genomes.

'''Guanine''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|w|ɑː|n|ᵻ|n}}; or '''G, Gua''') is one of the four main [[nucleobase]]s found in the [[nucleic acid]]s [[DNA]] and [[RNA]], the others being [[adenine]], [[cytosine]], and [[thymine]] ([[uracil]] in RNA). In [[DNA]], guanine is paired with cytosine. The guanine [[nucleoside]] is called [[guanosine]].

With the formula C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>5</sub>O, guanine is a derivative of [[purine]], consisting of a fused [[pyrimidine]]-[[imidazole]] ring system with conjugated double bonds. Being unsaturated, the bicyclic molecule is planar.

==Properties==
Guanine, along with adenine and cytosine, is present in both DNA and RNA, whereas thymine is usually seen only in DNA, and uracil only in RNA. Guanine has two [[tautomer]]ic forms, [[keto-enol tautomerism|the major keto form (see figures) and rare enol form]].
It binds to cytosine through three [[hydrogen bond]]s. In cytosine, the amino group acts as the hydrogen bond donor and the C-2 carbonyl and the N-3 amine as the hydrogen-bond acceptors. Guanine has the C-6 carbonyl group that acts as the hydrogen bond acceptor, while a group at N-1 and the amino group at C-2 act as the hydrogen bond donors.

Guanine can be [[hydrolyzed]] with strong acid to [[glycine]], [[ammonia]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[carbon monoxide]]. First, guanine gets [[Deamination|deaminated]] to become [[xanthine]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Angstadt | title=Purines and pyrimidines | url=http://library.med.utah.edu/NetBiochem/pupyr/pp.htm |accessdate=2008-03-27}}</ref> Guanine oxidizes more readily than adenine, the other purine-derivative base in DNA. Its high melting point of 350&nbsp;°C reflects the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the oxo and amino groups in the molecules in the crystal. Because of this intermolecular bonding, guanine is relatively insoluble in water, but it is soluble in dilute acids and bases.

==History==
The first isolation of guanine was reported in 1844 by the German chemist Julius Bodo Unger (1819–1885), who obtained it from the excreta of sea birds, which is known as [[guano]] and which was used as a source of fertilizer; guanine was named in 1846.<ref>Guanine was first isolated in 1844 by Julius Bodo Unger (1819–1885), a student of Prof. [[Heinrich Gustav Magnus]].

==Syntheses==
Trace amounts of guanine form by the [[polymerization]] of [[ammonium cyanide]] ({{chem|NH|4|CN}}). Two experiments conducted by Levy et al. showed that heating 10&nbsp;mol·L<sup>−1</sup> {{chem|NH|4|CN}} at 80&nbsp;°C for 24 hours gave a yield of 0.0007%, while using 0.1&nbsp;mol·L<sup>−1</sup> {{chem|NH|4|CN}} frozen at −20&nbsp;°C for 25 years gave a 0.0035% yield. These results indicate guanine could arise in frozen regions of the primitive earth. In 1984, Yuasa reported a 0.00017% yield of guanine after the electrical discharge of {{chem|NH|3}}, {{chem|CH|4}}, {{chem|C|2|H|6}}, and 50&nbsp;mL of water, followed by a subsequent acid hydrolysis. However, it is unknown whether the presence of guanine was not simply a resultant contaminant of the reaction.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Levy | first = Matthew |author2=Stanley L.

A [[Fischer-Tropsch]] synthesis can also be used to form guanine, along with [[adenine]], [[uracil]], and [[thymine]]. Heating an equimolar gas mixture of CO, H<sub>2</sub>, and NH<sub>3</sub> to 700&nbsp;°C for 15 to 24 minutes, followed by quick cooling and then sustained reheating to 100 to 200&nbsp;°C for 16 to 44 hours with an alumina catalyst, yielded guanine and uracil:
:10CO + H<sub>2</sub> + 10NH<sub>3</sub> → 2C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>8</sub>N<sub>5</sub>O (guanine) + 8H<sub>2</sub>O

Another possible abiotic route was explored by quenching a 90% N<sub>2</sub>–10%CO–H<sub>2</sub>O gas mixture high-temperature plasma.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Miyakawa | first = S |author2=Murasawa, K. |author3=Kobayashi, K. |author4=Sawaoka, AB. | title = Abiotic synthesis of guanine with high-temperature plasma | journal = Orig Life Evol Biosph. | volume = 30 | issue = 6 | pages = 557–66 |date=December 2000 | doi = 10.1023/A:1026587607264 | pmid = 11196576}}</ref>

==Other occurrences/ biological uses==
The word guanine derives from the Spanish loanword ''guano'' ("bird/bat droppings"), which itself is from the [[Quechua language|Quechua]] word ''wanu'', meaning "dung". As the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] notes, guanine is "A white amorphous substance obtained abundantly from guano, forming a constituent of the excrement of birds".<ref>OED. "guanine" and also "guano".</ref>

It is a [[pyrimidine]] derivative, with a [[heterocyclic]] [[aromatic ring]] and two substituents attached (an [[amine]] group at position 4 and a [[Ketone|keto]] group at position 2). The [[nucleoside]] of cytosine is [[cytidine]].  In Watson-Crick [[base pair]]ing, it forms three(3) hydrogen bonds with [[guanine]].

==History==
Cytosine was discovered and named by [[Albrecht Kossel]] and Albert Neumann in 1894 when it was hydrolyzed from calf [[thymus]] tissues.<ref>A.

In March 2015, NASA scientists reported the formation of cytosine, along with uracil and thymine, from [[pyrimidine]] under the space-like laboratory conditions, which is of interest because pyrimidine has been found in meteorites although its origin is unknown.<ref name="NASA-20150303">{{cite web |last=Marlaire |first=Ruth |title=NASA Ames Reproduces the Building Blocks of Life in Laboratory |url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-ames-reproduces-the-building-blocks-of-life-in-laboratory |date=3 March 2015 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=5 March 2015 }}</ref>

==Chemical reactions==
[[File:Cytosine chemical structure.svg|thumb|left|100px|Cytosine with numbered components. [[Methylation]] occurs on carbon number 5.]]
Cytosine can be found as part of DNA, as part of RNA, or as a part of a [[nucleotide]]. As [[cytidine triphosphate]] (CTP), it can act as a co-factor to enzymes, and can transfer a phosphate to convert [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP) to [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP).

In DNA and RNA, cytosine is paired with [[guanine]]. However, it is inherently unstable, and can change into [[uracil]] ([[deamination|spontaneous deamination]]). This can lead to a [[point mutation]] if not repaired by the [[DNA repair]] [[enzyme]]s such as uracil glycosylase, which cleaves a uracil in DNA.

When found third in a [[codon]] of [[RNA]], cytosine is synonymous with [[uracil]], as they are interchangeable as the third base.
When found as the second base in a codon, the third is always interchangeable. For example, UCU, UCC, UCA and UCG are all [[serine]], regardless of the third base.

Cytosine can also be [[Methylation|methylated]] into [[5-Methylcytosine|5-methylcytosine]] by an enzyme called [[DNA methyltransferase]] or be methylated and [[Hydroxylation|hydroxylated]] to make [[5-Hydroxymethylcytosine|5-hydroxymethylcytosine]].
Active enzymatic deamination of cytosine or 5-methylcytosine by the [[APOBEC]] family of cytosine deaminases could have both beneficial and detrimental implications on various cellular processes as well as on organismal evolution.<ref name="Chahwan">{{cite journal|author1=Chahwan R. |author2=Wontakal S.N. |author3=Roa S. | title=Crosstalk between genetic and epigenetic information through cytosine deamination| journal=Trends in Genetics| volume = 26| pages = 443–448| year = 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2010.07.005| pmid = 20800313| issue = 10}}</ref> The implications of deamination on 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, on the other hand, remains less understood.

== Theoretical aspects ==
Cytosine has not been found in meteorites, which suggests the first strands of RNA and DNA had to look elsewhere to obtain this building block. Cytosine likely formed within some meteorite parent bodies, however did not persist within these bodies due to an effective [[deamination]] reaction into [[uracil]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/did-the-seeds-of-life-come-from-space/|title=Did the Seeds of Life Come from Space?|last=Tasker|first=Elizabeth|newspaper=Scientific American Blog Network|access-date=2016-11-24}}</ref>

== Medical uses ==

=== Antifungal ===
One of the main uses of amphotericin B is treating a wide range of systemic [[Fungal infection in animals|fungal infection]]s. Due to its extensive side effects, it is often reserved for severe infections in critically ill, or [[immunocompromised]] patients. It is considered first line therapy for invasive [[mucormycosis]] infections, [[Cryptococcosis|cryptococcal meningitis]], and certain [[Aspergillosis|aspergillus]] and [[Candidiasis|candidal]] infections.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Drugs Active against Fungi, Pneumocystis, and Microsporidia|publisher = |year = |isbn = 978-1-4557-4801-3|location = |pages = 479–494.e4}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Liposomal Amphotericin B|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00003495-200969030-00010|journal = Drugs|date = 2012-09-17|issn = 0012-6667|pages = 361–392|volume = 69|issue = 3|doi = 10.2165/00003495-200969030-00010|first = Marit D.|last = Moen|first2 = Katherine A.|last2 = Lyseng-Williamson|first3 = Lesley J.|last3 = Scott|pmid=19275278}}</ref> It has been a highly effective drug for over fifty years in large part because it has a low incidence of drug resistance in the pathogens it treats. This is because amphotericin B resistance requires sacrifices on the part of the pathogen that make it susceptible to the host environment, and too weak to cause infection.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wi.mit.edu/news/archive/2013/understanding-evolution-drug-resistance-points-novel-strategy-developing-better|title=Understanding the evolution of drug resistance points to novel strategy for developing better antimicrobials|last=Rura|first=Nicole|date=2013-10-29|work=|access-date=2016-11-14|via=Whitehead Institute|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115134239/http://wi.mit.edu/news/archive/2013/understanding-evolution-drug-resistance-points-novel-strategy-developing-better|archivedate=2016-11-15|df=}}</ref> Lipid formulations of amphotericin B should not be used to treat urinary tract infections because they do not penetrate into the kidney or achieve adequate concentrations in the urine.<ref>Gary M Cox, Carol A Kaufmann;Candida infections of bladder and kidney.

== Route of administration ==

=== Intravenous formulations ===
Amphotericin B alone is [[Solubility|insoluble]] in [[Saline (medicine)|normal saline]] at a [[pH]] of 7. Therefore, several formulations have been devised to improve its intravenous bioavailability.<ref name=":7" />

==== Deoxycholate ====

==Side effects==
Amphotericin B is well known for its severe and potentially lethal side effects. Very often, it causes a serious reaction soon after infusion (within 1 to 3 hours), consisting of high fever, shaking chills, [[hypotension]], [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[headache]], [[dyspnea]] and [[tachypnea]], [[drowsiness]], and generalized weakness. The violent chills and fevers have been nicknamed "shake and bake".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Shake+and+Bake|title=Shake and Bake|newspaper=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2016-12-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chem.uwec.edu/chem491_w09/ambliposomereview.pdf|title=Studies on Amphotericin B|last=Hartsel|first=Scott|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=8 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220113409/http://www.chem.uwec.edu/chem491_w09/ambliposomereview.pdf|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=}}</ref> This reaction sometimes subsides with later applications of the drug, and may in part be due to histamine liberation. An increase in [[prostaglandin]] synthesis may also play a role. This nearly universal febrile response necessitates a critical (and diagnostically difficult) professional determination as to whether the onset of high fever is a novel symptom of a fast-progressing disease, or merely the effect of the drug. To decrease the likelihood and severity of the symptoms, initial doses should be low, and increased slowly. [[Paracetamol]], [[pethidine]], [[diphenhydramine]], and [[hydrocortisone]] have all been used to treat or prevent the syndrome, but the prophylactic use of these drugs is often limited by the patient's condition.

Intravenously administered amphotericin B in therapeutic doses has also been associated with multiple organ damage. [[Nephrotoxicity|Kidney damage]] is a frequently reported side effect, and can be severe and/or irreversible. Less kidney toxicity has been reported with liposomal formulations (such as AmBisome) and it has become preferred in patients with preexisting renal injury.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Liposomal Amphotericin B for Empirical Therapy in Patients with Persistent Fever and Neutropenia|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJM199903113401004|journal = New England Journal of Medicine|date = 1999-03-11|issn = 0028-4793|pmid = 10072411|pages = 764–771|volume = 340|issue = 10|doi = 10.1056/NEJM199903113401004|first = Thomas J.|last = Walsh|first2 = Robert W.|last2 = Finberg|first3 = Carola|last3 = Arndt|first4 = John|last4 = Hiemenz|first5 = Cindy|last5 = Schwartz|first6 = David|last6 = Bodensteiner|first7 = Peter|last7 = Pappas|first8 = Nita|last8 = Seibel|first9 = Richard N.|last9 = Greenberg}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Cryptococcal Disease: 2010 Update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America|url = http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/3/291|journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases|date = 2010-02-01|issn = 1058-4838|pmid = 20047480|pages = 291–322|volume = 50|issue = 3|doi = 10.1086/649858|first = John R.|last = Perfect|first2 = William E.|last2 = Dismukes|first3 = Francoise|last3 = Dromer|first4 = David L.|last4 = Goldman|first5 = John R.|last5 = Graybill|first6 = Richard J.|last6 = Hamill|first7 = Thomas S.|last7 = Harrison|first8 = Robert A.|last8 = Larsen|first9 = Olivier|last9 = Lortholary|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160521004400/http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/3/291|archivedate = 2016-05-21|df = }}</ref> The integrity of the liposome is disrupted when it binds to the fungal cell wall, but is not affected by the mammalian cell membrane,<ref>Jill Adler-Moore,* and Richard T. liposomal formulation, structure, mechanism of action and pre-clinical experience.

==Interactions==
* [[Flucytosine]]: Toxicity of flucytosine is increased and allows a lower dose of amphotericin B. Amphotericin B may also facilitate entry of flucystosine into the fungal cell by interfering with the permeability of the fungal cell membrane.
* Diuretics or [[cisplatin]]: Increased renal toxicity and increased risk of hypokalemia
* [[Corticosteroid]]s: Increased risk of hypokalemia
* Cytostatic drugs: Increased risk of kidney damage, hypotension, and bronchospasms
* Other nephrotoxic drugs (such as aminoglycosides): Increased risk of serious renal damage
* [[Foscarnet]], [[ganciclovir]], [[tenofovir]], [[adefovir]]: Risk of hematological and renal side effects of amphotericin B are increased
* Transfusion of leukocytes: Risk of pulmonal (lung) damage occurs, space the intervals between the application of amphotericin B and the transfusion, and monitor pulmonary function

==Mechanism of action==
Amphotericin B binds with [[ergosterol]], a component of fungal cell membranes, forming pores that cause rapid leakage of [[monovalent ion]]s ([[potassium|K<sup>+</sup>]], [[sodium|Na<sup>+</sup>]], [[hydrogen|H<sup>+</sup>]] and [[chloride|Cl<sup>−</sup>]]) and subsequent fungal cell death. This is amphotericin B's primary effect as an antifungal agent.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|title = It only takes one to do many jobs: Amphotericin B as antifungal and immunomodulatory drug|url = http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2012.00286/abstract|journal = Fungi and Their Interactions|date = 2012-01-01|pmc = 3441194|pmid = 23024638|pages = 286|volume = 3|doi = 10.3389/fmicb.2012.00286|first = Ana Cecilia|last = Mesa-Arango|first2 = Liliana|last2 = Scorzoni|first3 = Oscar|last3 = Zaragoza|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117173202/http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2012.00286/abstract|archivedate = 2015-11-17|df = }}</ref><ref name="O'Keeffe">{{Cite journal|title = Exposure of the yeast Candida albicans to the anti-neoplastic agent adriamycin increases the tolerance to amphotericin B|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1211/0022357022359/abstract|journal = Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology|date = 2003-12-01|issn = 2042-7158|pages = 1629–1633|volume = 55|issue = 12|doi = 10.1211/0022357022359|first = Joseph|last = O'Keeffe|first2 = Sean|last2 = Doyle|first3 = Kevin|last3 = Kavanagh|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151204084917/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1211/0022357022359/abstract|archivedate = 2015-12-04|df = }}</ref> It has been found that the amphotericin B/ergosterol bimolecular complex that maintains these pores is stabilized by Van der Waals interactions.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Molecular modelling of amphotericin B-ergosterol primary complex in water II|journal=Biophysical Chemistry|volume=141}}</ref> Researchers have found evidence that amphotericin B also causes [[oxidative stress]] within the fungal cell,<ref name=Baginski2009>{{cite journal |last1= Baginski |first1= M. |last2= Czub |first2= J. |title= Amphotericin B and Its New Derivatives–Mode of Action |journal= Current Drug Metabolism |volume= 10 |issue= 5 |year= 2009 |pages= 459–69 |pmid= 19689243 |doi=10.2174/138920009788898019}}</ref> but it remains unclear to what extent this oxidative damage contributes to the drug's effectiveness.<ref name=":3"/> The addition of [[free radical]] scavengers or [[antioxidant]]s can lead to amphotericin resistance in some species, such as ''[[Scedosporium prolificans]]'', without affecting the cell wall.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Two amphotericins, amphotericin A and amphotericin B, are known, but only B is used clinically, because it is significantly more active ''[[in vivo]]''.  Amphotericin A is almost identical to amphotericin B (having a C=C double bond between the 27th and 28th carbons), but has little antifungal activity.<ref name=":7" />

==Mechanism of toxicity==
Mammalian and fungal membranes both contain sterols, a primary membrane target for amphotericin B. Because mammalian and fungal membranes are similar in structure and composition, this is one mechanism by which amphotericin B causes cellular toxicity. Amphotericin B molecules can form pores in the host membrane as well as the fungal membrane. This impairment in membrane barrier function can have lethal effects.<ref name=Baginski2009/><ref name="Laniado-Laborin R 2009">Laniado-Laborin R. and Cabrales-Vargas MN.

===Formulations===
It is a subgroup of the macrolide antibiotics, and exhibits similar structural elements.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Chemistry and Biology of the Polyene Macrolide Antibiotics|journal=Bacteriological Reviews|volume=32}}</ref> Currently, the drug is available in many forms. Either "conventionally" complexed with sodium deoxycholate (ABD), as a cholesteryl sulfate complex (ABCD), as a lipid complex (ABLC), and as a [[liposome|liposomal]] formulation (LAMB). The latter formulations have been developed to improve tolerability and decrease toxicity, but may show considerably different [[Pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] characteristics compared to conventional amphotericin B.<ref name=":0" />

===Names===

==Medical uses==
Cytarabine is mainly used in the treatment of [[acute myeloid leukaemia]], [[acute lymphocytic leukaemia]] (ALL) and in [[lymphoma]]s,<ref name="pmid18024370">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pigneux A, Perreau V, Jourdan E |title=Adding lomustine to idarubicin and cytarabine for induction chemotherapy in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia: the BGMT 95 trial results |journal=Haematologica |volume=92 |issue=10 |pages=1327–34 |date=October 2007 |pmid=18024370 |doi=10.3324/haematol.11068 |url=http://www.haematologica.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18024370|display-authors=etal}}</ref> where it is the backbone of [[induction chemotherapy]].

Cytarabine also possesses [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]] activity, and it has been used for the treatment of generalised [[herpesvirus]] infection. However, cytarabine is not very selective in this setting and causes [[bone marrow suppression]] and other severe side effects.
Therefore, ara-C is not a useful antiviral agent in humans because of its toxic profile<ref name="pmid15825312">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Lauter | first1 = CB. | last2 = Bailey | first2 = EJ. | last3 = Lerner | first3 = AM. | title = Assessment of cytosine arabinoside as an antiviral agent in humans. | journal = Antimicrob Agents Chemother | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 598–602 |date=Nov 1974 | doi =  10.1128/aac.6.5.598| PMID = 15825312 | pmc=444699}}</ref> and actually it is used mainly for the chemotherapy of hematologic [[cancers]].

Cytarabine is also used in the study of the [[nervous system]] to control the proliferation of [[glial]] cells in cultures, the amount of glial cells having an important impact on [[neuron]]s.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Side effects==
One of the unique toxicities of cytarabine is [[cerebellar]] toxicity when given in high doses, which may lead to [[ataxia]].  Cytarabine may cause [[granulocytopenia]] and other impaired body defenses, which may lead to infection, and [[thrombocytopenia]], which may lead to [[hemorrhage]].

Toxicity:  [[leukopenia]], thrombocytopenia, [[anemia]], GI disturbances, [[stomatitis]], [[conjunctivitis]], [[pneumonitis]], [[fever]], and [[dermatitis]], [[Chemotherapy-induced acral erythema|palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia]].  Rarely, [[myelopathy]] has been reported after high dose or frequent [[intrathecal]] Ara-C administration.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Watterson J, Toogood I, Nieder M | title = Excessive spinal cord toxicity from intensive central nervous system-directed therapies| journal = Cancer| volume = 74| issue = 11| pages = 3034–41| date=December 1994| pmid = 7954266| doi = 10.1002/1097-0142(19941201)74:11<3034::AID-CNCR2820741122>3.0.CO;2-O|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

When used in protocols designated as high dose, cytarabine can cause cerebral and cerebellar dysfunction, ocular toxicity, pulmonary toxicity, severe GI ulceration and [[peripheral neuropathy]] (rare).

To prevent the side effects and improve the therapeutic efficiency, various derivatives of these drugs (including amino acid, peptide, fatty acid and phosphates) have been evaluated, as well as different delivery systems.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chhikara BS, Parang K |title =Development of cytarabine prodrugs and delivery systems for leukemia treatment |journal = Expert Opinion on Drug Delivery |volume = 7 |issue = 12 |pages = 1399–1414 |year = 2010 |doi = 10.1517/17425247.2010.527330 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1517/17425247.2010.527330 }}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Cytosine arabinoside combines a [[cytosine]] base with an [[arabinose]] sugar. It is an [[antimetabolic agent]] with the chemical name of ''1β-arabinofuranosylcytosine''. Certain sponges, where it was originally found, use arabinoside sugars to form a different compound (not part of DNA). Cytosine arabinoside is similar enough to human cytosine deoxyribose (deoxycytidine) to be incorporated into human DNA, but different enough that it kills the cell. Cytosine arabinoside interferes with the synthesis of DNA. Its mode of action is due to its rapid conversion into [[cytosine arabinoside triphosphate]], which damages [[DNA]] when the [[cell cycle]] holds in the [[S phase]] (synthesis of DNA). Rapidly dividing cells, which require DNA replication for [[mitosis]], are therefore most affected. Cytosine arabinoside also inhibits both [[DNA polymerase|DNA]]<ref name="isbn0-7817-7328-8">{{cite book |author=Perry, Michael J. |title=The Chemotherapy source book |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2008 |pages=80 |isbn=0-7817-7328-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> and [[RNA polymerase]]s and [[nucleotide]] reductase enzymes needed for DNA synthesis. Cytarabine is the first of a series of cancer drugs that altered the sugar component of [[nucleosides]]. Other cancer drugs modify the base.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pfeist.net/ALL/arac/ | title = A Tale from the Sea to Ara C | last = Feist | first = Patty | date = April 2005 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070306220251/http://www.pfeist.net/ALL/arac/ | archivedate = 2007-03-06 | df =  }}</ref>

In 2006, the large STAR clinical study concluded that [[raloxifene]] is equally effective in reducing the incidence of breast cancer, but after an average 4-year follow-up, although the difference was not statistically significant, there were 36% fewer [[uterine cancer]]s and 29% fewer blood clots in women taking raloxifene than in women taking tamoxifen.<ref name="NCI">{{cite web| url = http://www.cancer.gov/star| title = Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) Trial| accessdate = July 3, 2007| author = National Cancer Institute| date = 2006-04-26| publisher = U.S. National Institutes of Health| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070704091218/http://www.cancer.gov/star| archivedate = July 4, 2007| df = }}</ref><ref name="STAR">{{cite web | url = http://www.nsabp.pitt.edu/STAR/Index.html| title = STAR Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifen | accessdate = July 3, 2007| author = University of Pittsburgh | date = | publisher = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070611194336/http://www.nsabp.pitt.edu/STAR/Index.html |archivedate = June 11, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dslrf.org/breastcancer/content.asp?L2=2&L3=6&SID=130&CID=391&PID=14&CATID=0 | title = Study Finds New Use for Raloxifene: Reducing Breast Cancer in High-Risk Postmenopausal Women | accessdate = March 19, 2009 | author = Dr [[Susan Love]] | date = April 22, 2006 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090802013050/http://www.dslrf.org/breastcancer/content.asp?L2=2&L3=6&SID=130&CID=391&PID=14&CATID=0 | archivedate = August 2, 2009 | df =  }}</ref>

===Infertility===
Tamoxifen is used to treat infertility in women with [[Anovulatory cycle|anovulatory]] disorders.

Tamoxifen improves fertility in males with infertility by disinhibiting the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (via ER antagonism) and thereby increasing the secretion of [[luteinizing hormone]] and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] and increasing testicular [[testosterone]] production.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chua ME, Escusa KG, Luna S, Tapia LC, Dofitas B, Morales M | title = Revisiting oestrogen antagonists (clomiphene or tamoxifen) as medical empiric therapy for idiopathic male infertility: a meta-analysis | journal = Andrology | volume = 1 | issue = 5 | pages = 749–57 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23970453 | doi = 10.1111/j.2047-2927.2013.00107.x }}</ref>

==Side effects==
A report in September 2009 from Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality suggests that tamoxifen, raloxifene, and tibolone used to treat breast cancer significantly reduce invasive breast cancer in midlife and older women, but also increase the risk of adverse side effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oncogenetics.org/web/Medications-Effective-in-Reducing-Risk-of-Breast-Cancer-But-Increase-Risk-of-Adverse-Effects |title=Medications Effective in Reducing Risk of Breast Cancer But Increase Risk of Adverse Effects |author=OncoGenetics.Org |publisher=OncoGenetics.Org |accessdate=2009-09-14 |date=September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924092345/http://www.oncogenetics.org/web/Medications-Effective-in-Reducing-Risk-of-Breast-Cancer-But-Increase-Risk-of-Adverse-Effects |archivedate=September 24, 2009 }}</ref>
 
Some cases of lower-limb lymphedema have been associated with the use of tamoxifen, due to the blood clots and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that can be caused by this medication. Resolution of the blood clots or DVT is needed before lymphedema treatment can be initiated.
 
===Bone===
A beneficial side effect of tamoxifen is that it prevents bone loss by acting as an ER [[agonist]] (i.e., mimicking the effects of estrogen) in this cell type. Therefore, by inhibiting [[osteoclasts]], it prevents [[osteoporosis]].<ref name="pmid17803905">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakamura T, Imai Y, Matsumoto T, Sato S, Takeuchi K, Igarashi K, Harada Y, Azuma Y, Krust A, Yamamoto Y, Nishina H, Takeda S, Takayanagi H, Metzger D, Kanno J, Takaoka K, Martin TJ, Chambon P, Kato S | title = Estrogen prevents bone loss via estrogen receptor alpha and induction of Fas ligand in osteoclasts | journal = Cell | volume = 130 | issue = 5 | pages = 811–23 | date = Sep 2007 | pmid = 17803905 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2007.07.025 }}</ref><ref name="pmid18219273">{{cite journal | vauthors = Krum SA, Miranda-Carboni GA, Hauschka PV, Carroll JS, Lane TF, Freedman LP, Brown M | title = Estrogen protects bone by inducing Fas ligand in osteoblasts to regulate osteoclast survival | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 535–45 | date = Feb 2008 | pmid = 18219273 | pmc = 2241656 | doi = 10.1038/sj.emboj.7601984 }}</ref> When tamoxifen was launched as a drug, it was thought that tamoxifen would act as an ER antagonist in all tissue, including bone, and therefore it was feared that it would contribute to osteoporosis.

4-OHT binds to ER competitively (with respect to the endogenous agonist estrogen) in tumor cells and other tissue targets, producing a nuclear complex that decreases DNA synthesis and inhibits estrogen effects. It is a nonsteroidal agent with potent antiestrogenic properties which compete with estrogen for [[Cell signaling|binding sites]] in breast and other tissues. Tamoxifen causes cells to remain in the G<sub>0</sub> and G<sub>1</sub> phases of the [[cell cycle]]. Because it prevents (pre)cancerous cells from dividing but does not cause cell death, tamoxifen is cytostatic rather than cytocidal.
 
The scientific literature is complex with respect to the activity of tamoxifen, and care should be taken to establish whether tamoxifen, or the 4-hydroxy metabolite was used, especially in in vitro assays.

N,N-Didesmethyl-4-hydroxytamoxifen ([[norendoxifen]]), another [[active metabolite]] of tamoxifen, has been found to act as a potent competitive [[aromatase inhibitor]] ([[IC50|IC<sub>50</sub>]] = 90 nM), and may also be involved in its antiestrogenic activity.<ref name="pmid23824607">{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu J, Flockhart PJ, Lu D, Lv W, Lu WJ, Han X, Cushman M, Flockhart DA | title = Inhibition of cytochrome p450 enzymes by the e- and z-isomers of norendoxifen | journal = Drug Metab.

==History==
In the late 1950s, pharmaceutical companies were actively researching a newly discovered class of anti-estrogen compounds in the hope of developing a morning-after contraceptive pill.
Arthur L Walpole was a reproductive [[endocrinologist]] who led such a team at the [[Alderley Park]] research laboratories of [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] Pharmaceuticals.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jordan VC | title = Tamoxifen (ICI46,474) as a targeted therapy to treat and prevent breast cancer | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 147 Suppl 1 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = S269–76 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16402113 | pmc = 1760730 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjp.0706399 }}</ref> It was there in 1966 that Dora Richardson first synthesised tamoxifen, known then as ICI-46,474.<ref name="isbn0-471-89979-8">{{cite book | last = Sneader | first = Walter | name-list-format = vanc | title = Drug Discovery: A History | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-471-89979-8 | oclc = | doi = | page = 472 pages }}</ref>
Walpole and his colleagues filed a UK patent covering this compound in 1962, but patent protection on this compound was repeatedly denied in the US until the 1980s.<ref name="Jordan_2003">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jordan VC | title = Tamoxifen: a most unlikely pioneering medicine | journal = Nature Reviews.

A link between estrogen and breast cancer had been known for many years, but cancer treatments were not a corporate priority at the time, and Walpole's personal interests were important in keeping support for the compound alive in the face of this and the lack of patent protection.<ref name="Jordan_2006" />

Tamoxifen is one of three drugs in an [[angiogenesis inhibitor|anti-angiogenetic]] protocol developed by [[Judah Folkman|Dr. Judah Folkman]], a researcher at Children's Hospital at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Folkman discovered in the 1970s that [[angiogenesis]] – the growth of new blood vessels – plays a significant role in the development of cancer. Since his discovery, an entirely new field of cancer research has developed. Clinical trials on [[angiogenesis inhibitor]]s have been underway since 1992 using myriad different drugs. The Harvard researchers developed a specific protocol for a golden retriever named Navy who was cancer-free after receiving the prescribed cocktail of [[celecoxib]], [[doxycycline]], and tamoxifen – the treatment subsequently became known as the Navy Protocol.<ref name="urlUSA_Today">{{cite web | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2002-07-24-cover-cancer_x.htm | title = Dog's tale of survival opens door in cancer research | author = Kirk E | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | date = 2002-07-24 | work = Health and Behavior | publisher = USA Today | pages =  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080628110635/http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2002-07-24-cover-cancer_x.htm | archivedate = 2008-06-28 | quote =  | accessdate = 2008-06-24 | deadurl = no | df =  }}</ref> Furthermore, tamoxifen treatment alone has been shown to have anti-angiogenetic effects in animal models of cancer which appear to be, at least in part, independent of tamoxifen's ER antagonist properties.<ref name="pmid11106254">{{cite journal | vauthors = Blackwell KL, Haroon ZA, Shan S, Saito W, Broadwater G, Greenberg CS, Dewhirst MW | title = Tamoxifen inhibits angiogenesis in estrogen receptor-negative animal models | journal = Clinical Cancer Research | volume = 6 | issue = 11 | pages = 4359–64 | date = Nov 2000 | pmid = 11106254 | doi =  | url = http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/6/11/4359 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080906195254/http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/6/11/4359 | archivedate = 2008-09-06 | df =  }}</ref>

==Research==
Tamoxifen is used as a research tool to trigger tissue-specific gene expression in many conditional expression constructs in genetically modified animals including a version of the [[Cre-Lox recombination]] technique.<ref name="pmid8855277">{{cite journal | vauthors = Feil R, Brocard J, Mascrez B, LeMeur M, Metzger D, Chambon P | title = Ligand-activated site-specific recombination in mice | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 93 | issue = 20 | pages = 10887–90 | date = Oct 1996 | pmid = 8855277 | pmc = 38252 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.20.10887 | bibcode = 1996PNAS...9310887F }}</ref>

The drug has also been studied in several additional indications.

===Riedel's thyroiditis===
Tamoxifen has been proposed as part of a treatment plan for [[Riedel's thyroiditis]].<ref name="pmid12698518">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dabelic N, Jukic T, Labar Z, Novosel SA, Matesa N, Kusic Z | title = Riedel's thyroiditis treated with tamoxifen | journal = Croatian Medical Journal | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 239–41 | date = Apr 2003 | pmid = 12698518 | doi =  | url = http://www.cmj.hr/2003/44/2/12698518.pdf | format = PDF | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080910130853/http://www.cmj.hr/2003/44/2/12698518.pdf | archivedate = 2008-09-10 | df =  }}</ref>

===Bipolar disorder===
Tamoxifen has been shown to be effective in the treatment of [[mania]] in patients with [[bipolar disorder]] by blocking [[protein kinase C]] (PKC), an [[enzyme]] that regulates [[neuron]] activity in the [[brain]]. Researchers believe PKC is over-active during the mania in bipolar patients.<ref name="nimh">{{cite web |publisher= [[National Institute of Mental Health|National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)]] |title= Manic Phase of Bipolar Disorder Benefits from Breast Cancer Medication |url= http://www.nimh.nih.gov/science-news/2007/manic-phase-of-bipolar-disorder-benefits-from-breast-cancer-medication.shtml |date= September 12, 2007 |accessdate= 2008-03-10 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071013184947/http://nimh.nih.gov/science-news/2007/manic-phase-of-bipolar-disorder-benefits-from-breast-cancer-medication.shtml |archivedate= October 13, 2007 |df=  }}</ref><ref name="pmid18316672">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yildiz A, Guleryuz S, Ankerst DP, Ongür D, Renshaw PF | title = Protein kinase C inhibition in the treatment of mania: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of tamoxifen | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 65 | issue = 3 | pages = 255–63 | date = Mar 2008 | pmid = 18316672 | doi = 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2007.43 }}</ref>

===McCune-Albright syndrome===
In [[McCune-Albright syndrome]] (MAS) tamoxifen has been used to treat [[premature puberty]] and the consequences of premature puberty.

However, one ''in vitro'' study in 2007 and later an ''in vivo'' study in 2008 have shown that tamoxifen induces apoptosis in growth plate chondrocytes, reduces serum [[IGF-I]] levels and causes persistent retardation of longitudinal and cortical radial bone growth in young male rats, leading the researches to express concern giving tamoxifen to growing individuals.<ref name="pmid18348701"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chagin AS, Karimian E, Zaman F, Takigawa M, Chrysis D, Sävendahl L | title = Tamoxifen induces permanent growth arrest through selective induction of apoptosis in growth plate chondrocytes in cultured rat metatarsal bones | journal = Bone | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = 1415–24 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17293177 | doi = 10.1016/j.bone.2006.12.066 }}</ref>

'''Aminoglutethimide''' is an anti-[[steroid]] drug marketed under the tradename '''Cytadren''' by [[Novartis]] around the world. It blocks the production of steroids derived from [[cholesterol]] and is clinically used in the treatment of [[Cushing's syndrome]]<ref name="pmid17961023">{{cite journal |vauthors =Gross BA, Mindea SA, Pick AJ, Chandler JP, Batjer HH |title=Medical management of Cushing disease |journal=Neurosurgical Focus |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=E10 |year=2007 |pmid=17961023 |doi=10.3171/foc.2007.23.3.12 |url=http://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/foc.2007.23.3.12?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}</ref> and metastatic [[breast cancer]]. It is also used by [[bodybuilding|bodybuilders]].

==Medical uses==
Aminoglutethimide is indicated in conjunction with other drugs for the suppression of [[adrenal]] function in patients with [[Cushing's syndrome]].

It is also a second or third line choice for the treatment of [[hormone]]-sensitive ([[estrogen]] and [[progesterone]]) [[metastatic]] [[breast cancer]].

==Non-medical uses==
Aminoglutethimide is abused by bodybuilders and other steroid users to lower circulating levels of cortisol in the body and prevent muscle loss. Cortisol is [[catabolic]] to protein in muscle and effective blockade of P450scc by aminogluthethimide at high doses prevents muscle loss.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Side effects==
Its side effects are skin rash, [[hepatotoxicity]], inhibition of [[cortisol]] in the human body, and it may also cause [[hypothyroidism]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}. Since cortisol helps break down [[muscle]], aminoglutethimide is used by [[bodybuilders]] in a [[steroid cycle]].

==Pharmacology==
Aminoglutethimide has two mechanisms of action:

# It blocks [[aromatase]]<ref name="pmid17602675">{{cite journal |vauthors =Siraki AG, Bonini MG, Jiang J, Ehrenshaft M, Mason RP |title=Aminoglutethimide-induced protein free radical formation on myeloperoxidase: a potential mechanism of agranulocytosis |journal=[[Chemical research in toxicology]] |volume=20 |issue=7 |pages=1038–45 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17602675 |pmc=2073000 |doi=10.1021/tx6003562}}</ref> in the generation of [[estrogens]] from [[androstenedione]] and [[testosterone]].
# It blocks the conversion of cholesterol to [[pregnenolone]] by inhibiting the enzyme [[P450scc]] and consequently decreases synthesis of all hormonally active [[steroids]].

At low doses, aminoglutethimide is only an effective inhibitor of aromatase, but at higher doses, it effectively blocks P450scc as well.

'''Mitoxantrone''' (INN, BAN, USAN; also known as '''Mitozantrone''' in Australia; trade name '''Novantrone''') is an [[anthracenedione]] [[antineoplastic]] agent.

==Uses==
Mitoxantrone is used to treat certain types of cancer, mostly [[metastasis|metastatic]] [[breast cancer]], [[acute myeloid leukemia]], and [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]. It improves the survival rate of children suffering from [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] relapse.<ref name="Parker">{{cite journal |vauthors=Parker C, Waters R, Leighton C, Hancock J, Sutton R, Moorman AV, Ancliff P, Morgan M, Masurekar A, Goulden N, Green N, Révész T, Darbyshire P, Love S, Saha V |title=Effect of mitoxantrone on outcome of children with first relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL R3): an open-label randomised trial |journal=Lancet |volume= 376|issue= 9757|pages= 2009–2017|year=2010 |pmid=21131038 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)62002-8 |pmc=3010035}}</ref>

The combination of mitoxantrone and [[prednisone]] is approved as a second-line treatment for metastatic hormone-refractory [[prostate cancer]]. Until recently this combination was the first line of treatment; however, a combination of [[docetaxel]] and prednisone improves survival rates and lengthens the disease-free period.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Cancer Chemotherapy |author=Katzung, Bertram G. |title=Basic and clinical pharmacology |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical Publishing Division |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=0-07-145153-6 |edition=10th |oclc=157011367}}</ref>
 
Mitoxantrone is also used to treat [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS), most notably the [[Multiple sclerosis#Clinical course|subset of the disease]] known as secondary-progressive MS. Absent a cure mitoxantrone is effective in slowing the progression of secondary-progressive MS and extending the time between relapses in both relapsing-remitting MS and progressive-relapsing MS.<ref name="Fox">{{cite journal |author=Fox E |title=Management of worsening multiple sclerosis with mitoxantrone: a review |journal=Clin Ther |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=461–74 |year=2006 |pmid=16750460 |doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2006.04.013}}</ref>

==Side effects==
Mitoxantrone, as with other drugs in its class,  may cause [[adverse drug reaction|adverse reactions]] of varying severity, including [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[hair loss]], heart damage and [[immunosuppression]], possibly with delayed onset. [[Cardiomyopathy]] is a particularly concerning effect as it is irreversible; thus regular monitoring with [[echocardiogram]]s or [[MUGA scan]]s is recommended for patients.

Because of the risk of cardiomyopathy, mitoxantrone carries a limit on the cumulative lifetime dose (based on body surface area) in MS patients.<ref name="FDA Postmarket Drug Safety">{{cite web|title=Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride (marketed as Novantrone and generics) – Healthcare Professional Sheet text version|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm126445.htm|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=19 September 2014|ref=fdapostmarket}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Danazol is used primarily in the treatment of [[endometriosis]]. It has also been used – mostly [[off-label]] – for other indications, namely in the management of [[menorrhagia]], [[fibrocystic breast disease]], [[immune thrombocytopenic purpura]], [[premenstrual syndrome]], [[mastodynia|breast pain]], and [[hereditary angioedema]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Rod Flower |author2=Humphrey P.

==Contraindications==
Danazol is contraindicated during [[pregnancy]] because it has the potential to [[virilization|virilize]] female [[fetus]]es. Women taking danazol should practice effective [[contraception]] to prevent pregnancy if [[human sexual activity|sexually active]].<ref name=Hoffman />

Since danazol is [[metabolism|metabolized]] by the [[liver]], it cannot be used by patients with [[liver disease]], and in patients receiving long-term therapy, liver function must be monitored on a periodic basis.

==Side effects==
{{See also|Anabolic steroid#Adverse effects}}

Androgenic side effects are of concern, as some women taking danazol may experience unwanted hair growth ([[hirsutism]]), [[acne vulgaris|acne]], irreversible [[voice change|deepening of the voice]],<ref name="NieschlagBehre2010" /> or adverse [[lipid profile|blood lipid profile]]s.<ref name=Hoffman /> In addition, [[breast atrophy]] and decreased breast size may occur.<ref name="NieschlagBehre2010" /> The drug may also cause [[hot flash]]es, [[elevated transaminases|elevation of liver enzyme]]s, and [[mood disorder|mood changes]].<ref name=Hoffman /> Some patients who use danazol experience [[weight gain]] and [[Water retention (medicine)|fluid retention]]. Due to its side effects, danazol is seldom prescribed continuously beyond six months.

The use of danazol for endometriosis has been linked to an increased risk of [[ovarian cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cottreau CM, Ness RB, Modugno F, Allen GO, Goodman MT |title=Endometriosis and Its Treatment with Danazol or Lupron in Relation to Ovarian Cancer |journal=Clinical Cancer Research |volume=9 |issue= 14|pages=5142–4 |year=2003 |pmid=14613992 |doi=}}</ref> Patients with endometriosis have specific risk factors for ovarian cancer, so this may not apply for other uses.

Danazol, like most other androgenic drugs, has been linked with an increased risk of [[liver tumors]]. These are generally [[benign tumor|benign]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Velazquez I, Alter BP |title=Androgens and liver tumors: Fanconi's anemia and non-Fanconi's conditions |journal=Am. J.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Danazol possesses a complex [[pharmacology]], with multiple [[mechanisms of action]].<ref name="JonesRock2015" /><ref name="ThomasRock2012">{{cite book|author1=Eric J.

====Modulation of steroid hormone receptors====
The [[steroid hormone receptor]] [[pharmacodynamics|activity profile]] of danazol is as follows:<ref name="NieschlagBehre2010" /><ref name="ThomasRock2012" />

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Receptor !! Affinity !! Effect
|-
| [[Androgen receptor]] || 90 nM || [[Agonist]]
|-
| [[Progesterone receptor]] || 6,000 nM || [[Agonist-antagonist]]
|-
| [[Glucocorticoid receptor]] || 5,000 nM || Agonist
|-
| [[Estrogen receptor]] || 80,000 nM || Agonist
|}

As such, danazol is described as a possessing high affinity for the AR, moderate affinity for the PR and GR, and poor affinity for the ER.<ref name="ThomasRock2012" /> As an androgen, danazol is described as weak, being about 200-fold less potent than testosterone in [[bioassay]]s.<ref name="AltchekDeligdisch2003" /> The drug can act as both an agonist and [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the PR depending on the bioassay, indicating that it could be regarded as a [[selective progesterone receptor modulator]].<ref name="ThomasRock2012" /> Although the [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] and [[intrinsic activity|efficacy]] of danazol itself at the PR are relatively low, ethisterone, one of the major metabolites of danazol, is described as a weak progestogen (and has been employed clinically as a progestogen), and this presumably balances the ''[[in vivo]]'' progestogenic activity of danazol.<ref name="Kurman2013">{{cite book|author=Robert J. Kurman|title=Blaustein's Pathology of the Female Genital Tract|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sM3eBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA390|date=17 April 2013|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4757-3889-6|pages=390–}}</ref> The activity of danazol at the ER is considered to be minimal, although at very high concentrations the drug can act significantly as an ER agonist.<ref name="ThomasRock2012" /> Danazol is considered to act significantly as an agonist of the GR, and thus, as a [[glucocorticoid]].<ref name="ThomasRock2012" /> In accordance, it can [[immunosuppression|suppress the immune system]].<ref name="JonesRock2015" /><ref name="ThomasRock2012" /><ref name="AltchekDeligdisch2003" />

====Inhibition of steroidogenesis enzymes====
Danazol has been found to act as an inhibitor of the following steroidogenesis enzymes:<ref name="ThomasRock2012" />

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Enzyme !! Affinity (K<sub>i</sub>) !! Inhibition type !! Est. inhibition at 2 μM
|-
| [[Cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme]] || 20 μM || Competitive || ?
|-
| [[3β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase|3β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ<sup>5-4</sup> isomerase]] || 5.8 μM || Competitive || 4.3%
|-
| [[17α-Hydroxylase]] || 2.4 μM || Competitive || 2.9%
|-
| [[17,20-Lyase]] || 1.9 μM || Competitive || 3.9%
|-
| [[17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] || 4.4 μM || Competitive || 15%

|-
| [[11β-Hydroxylase]] || 1 μM || Competitive || 21%
|-
| [[Aromatase]] || >100 μM || – || 0%
|}

Danazol has also been found to be a weak inhibitor of [[steroid sulfatase]] (K<sub>i</sub> = 2.3–8.2&nbsp;μM), the enzyme that converts {{abbrlink|DHEA-S|dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate}} to {{abbrlink|DHEA|dehydroepiandrosterone}} and [[estrone sulfate]] to [[estrone]] (which can then subsequently be transformed into estrone (with [[androstenedione]] as an intermediate) and [[estradiol]], respectively),<ref name="Shields-BotellaChetrite2005">{{cite journal|last1=Shields-Botella|first1=J.|last2=Chetrite|first2=G.|last3=Meschi|first3=S.|last4=Pasqualini|first4=J.R.|title=Effect of nomegestrol acetate on estrogen biosynthesis and transformation in MCF-7 and T47-D breast cancer cells|journal=The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology|volume=93|issue=1|year=2005|pages=1–13|issn=0960-0760|doi=10.1016/j.jsbmb.2004.11.004|pmid=15748827}}</ref> though another study reported its inhibition to be potent and potentially clinically relevant.<ref name="pmid6238495">{{cite journal | vauthors = Carlström K, Döberl A, Pousette A, Rannevik G, Wilking N | title = Inhibition of steroid sulfatase activity by danazol | journal = Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand Suppl | volume = 123 | issue = | pages = 107–11 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6238495 | doi = | url = }}</ref> Although in contradiction with the above data, another study found that danazol weakly inhibited aromatase as well, with 44% inhibition at a concentration of 10&nbsp;μM.<ref name="Shields-BotellaChetrite2005" />

For reference, circulating concentrations of danazol are in the range of 2&nbsp;μM at a dosage of 600&nbsp;mg/day in women.<ref name="ThomasRock2012" />

In accordance with the above, clinical studies have demonstrated that danazol directly and markedly inhibits [[adrenal gland|adrenal]], [[ovary|ovarian]], and [[testicle|testicular]] steroidogenesis ''[[in vivo]]''.<ref name="ThomasRock2012" /> The enzymatic production of [[estradiol]], [[progesterone]], and [[testosterone]] have all specifically been found to be inhibited.<ref name="ThomasRock2012" />

====Occupation and downregulation of carrier proteins====
Danazol is known to bind to two steroid hormone carrier proteins: [[sex hormone-binding globulin]] (SHBG), which binds [[androgen]]s and [[estrogen]]s; and [[transcortin]] (corticosteroid-binding globulin), which binds progesterone and [[cortisol]].<ref name="NieschlagBehre2010" /><ref name="ThomasRock2012" /> Binding of danazol to SHBG is considered to be more important clinically.<ref name="ThomasRock2012" /> By occupying SHBG and transcortin, danazol increases the ratio of free to [[plasma protein]]-bound testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, and cortisol.<ref name="NieschlagBehre2010" /><ref name="ThomasRock2012" /> The following table shows the difference in testosterone levels in untreated premenopausal women and women treated with danazol:<ref name="ThomasRock2012" />

{| class="wikitable"
|+ style="text-align: center;" | Testosterone protein binding in women

As can be seen, the percentage of free testosterone is tripled in women being treated with danazol.<ref name="ThomasRock2012" /><ref name="HelmsQuan2006">{{cite book|author1=Richard A.

Wakelin|author2=Howard I. Maibach|author3=Clive B.

It is noteworthy that 2-hydroxymethylethisterone, a major metabolite of danazol, circulates at concentrations 5–10 times greater than those of danazol and is twice as potent as danazol in displacing testosterone from SHBG.<ref name="Westphal2012">{{cite book|author=Ulrich Westphal|title=Steroid-Protein Interactions II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3DD6CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA256|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-82486-9|pages=256–}}</ref> As such, most of the occupation of SHBG by danazol may actually be due to this metabolite.<ref name="Westphal2012" />

====Antigonadotropic activity====
Via its weak progestogenic and androgenic activity, through activation of the PR and AR in the [[pituitary gland]], danazol produces [[antigonadotropic]] effects.<ref name="ThomasRock2012" /> Although its does not significantly affect basal [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) levels in premenopausal women (and hence does not profoundly suppress [[gonadotropin]] or sex hormone levels like other, stronger antigonadotropins do),<ref name="TollisonSatterthwaite2002">{{cite book|author1=C.

==Research==

===Telomere diseases===
A 2016 phase 1–2 prospective study orally administered 800&nbsp;mg per day to 27 patients with [[telomere]] diseases. The primary efficacy endpoint was a 20% reduction in the annual rate of telomere attrition measured. Toxic effects formed the primary safety endpoint. The study was halted early, after telomere attrition was reduced in all 12 patients who could be evaluated. 12 of 27 patients achieved the primary efficacy end point, 11 of whom increased telomere length at 24 months. [[Hematology|Hematologic]] responses (secondary efficacy endpoint) occurred in 10 of 12 patients who could be evaluated at 24 months. Elevated liver-enzyme levels and muscle cramps (known adverse effects) of grade 2 or less occurred in 41% and 33% of the patients, respectively.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Townsley|first=Danielle M.|last2=Dumitriu|first2=Bogdan|last3=Liu|first3=Delong|last4=Biancotto|first4=Angélique|last5=Weinstein|first5=Barbara|last6=Chen|first6=Christina|last7=Hardy|first7=Nathan|last8=Mihalek|first8=Andrew D.|last9=Lingala|first9=Shilpa|date=2016-05-18|title=Danazol Treatment for Telomere Diseases|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1515319|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|language=EN|volume=374|issue=20|pages=1922–1931|doi=10.1056/nejmoa1515319}}</ref>

==History and source==
Phorbol is a natural product found in many plants, especially those of the [[Euphorbiaceae]] and [[Thymelaeaceae]] families.<ref name=Wang2015>{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Xiao-Yang|last2=Liu|first2=Li-Ping|last3=Qin|first3=Guo-Wei|last4=Kang|first4=Ting-Guo|title=Tigliane Diterpenoids from the Euphorbiaceae and Thymelaeaceae Families|journal=Chemical Reviews|date=2015|volume=115|pages=2975–3011|doi=10.1021/cr200397n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Beutler|first1=John A.|last2=Alvarado|first2=Ada Belinda|last3=McCloud|first3=Thomas G.|title=Distribution of phorbol ester bioactivity in the euphorbiaceae|journal=Phytotherapy Research|date=1989|volume=3|issue=5|pages=188–192|doi=10.1002/ptr.2650030507}}</ref>  Phorbol is identified as the active constituent of the highly toxic New World tropical [[manchineel]] or 'beach apple' ''Hippomane mancinella''.<ref>{{Cite journal

The seeds and oil of ''C. tiglium'' have been used for hundreds of years in traditional medicine, generally as a purgative.  The seeds have been mentioned in Chinese herbal texts as early as 2000 years ago.<ref name=Zhang2013>{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Xiao-Long|last2=Wang|first2=Lun|last3=Li|first3=Fu|last4=Yu|first4=Kai|last5=Wang|first5=Ming-Kui|title=Cytotoxic Phorbol Esters of Croton tiglium|journal=Journal of Natural Products|date=2013|volume=13|pages=858–864|doi=10.1021/np300832n}}</ref>  The purgative effects of the oil are largely attributed to the high percentage of phorbol esters contained in the oil.

==Mechanism of action==
Phorbol derivatives work primarily by interacting with [[protein kinase C]] (PKC), although they can interact with other phospholipid membrane receptors.<ref name=Goel2007>{{cite journal|last1=Goel|first1=Gunjan|last2=Makkar|first2=Harinder P.S.|last3=Francis|first3=George|last4=Becker|first4=Klaus|title=Phorbol Esters: Structure, Biological Activity, and Toxicity in Animals|journal=International Journal of Toxicology|date=2007|volume=26|pages=279–288|doi=10.1080/10915810701464641}}</ref>  The esters bind to PKC in a similar way to its natural ligand, [[diacylglycerol]], and activate the kinase.<ref name=Li2010>{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Cai-Yan|last2=Devappa|first2=Rakshit K|last3=Liu|first3=Jian-Xin|last4=Lv|first4=Jian-Min|last5=Makkar|first5=HPS|last6=Becker|first6=K|title=Toxicity of Jatropha curcas phorbol esters in mice|journal=Food and Chemical Toxicology|date=February 2010|volume=48|issue=2|pages=620–625|doi=10.1016/j.fct.2009.11.042}}</ref>  Diacylglycerol is degraded quickly by the body, allowing PKC to be reversibly activated.  When phorbol esters bind to the receptor, they are not degraded as efficiently by the body, leading to constitutively active PK.<ref name=Goel2007/>  Protein kinase C is involved in a number of important cell signaling pathways.  Thus, phorbol ester exposure can show a wide range of results.  
[[File:PDB 1ptr EBI.jpg|thumb|Example of phorbol bound to a domain of protein kinase C]]
The main results of phorbol exposure are tumor promotion and inflammatory response.  Although phorbol is not a carcinogen itself, it greatly enhances the action of other substances and promotes tumor proliferation.  PKC is a key component in biological pathways controlling cell growth and differentiation.   When phorbol esters bind to PKC, cell proliferation pathways are activated.  This effect greatly promotes tumors when the cells are exposed to even a sub-carcinogenic amount of a substance.<ref name=Goel2007/>  
Protein kinase C is also involved in activation of inflammation pathways such as the [[NF-KB]] pathway.  Thus, exposure to phorbol products can induce an inflammatory response in tissues.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moscat|first1=Jorge|last2=Diaz-Meco|first2=María T|last3=Rennert|first3=Paul|title=NF-κB activation by protein kinase C isoforms and B-cell function|journal=EMBO Reports|date=January 2003|volume=4|issue=1|pages=31–36|doi=10.1038/sj.embor.embor704}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=NF-κB and Inflammation|url=http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/articles/biofiles/nf-b-and-inflammation.html|website=Sigma-Aldrich|publisher=Sigma-Aldrich|accessdate=7 May 2017}}</ref>  Symptoms can include edema and pain, especially to the skin and mucus membranes.<ref name=Wang2015/>
While phorbol itself doesn’t have irritant activity, nearly all phorbol esters are highly irritant, with a wide range of ID<sub>50</sub>s.<ref name=Wang2015/>  The [[Median lethal dose|LD<sub>50 </sub>]]of phorbol esters for male mice was found to be about 27&nbsp;mg/kg, with the mice showing hemorrhage and congestion of pulmonary blood vessels, as well as lesions throughout the body.<ref name=Li2010/>

==Total synthesis==
A [[total synthesis]] of enantiopure phorbol was developed in 2015.  While this synthesis will not replace natural isolation products, it will enable researchers to create phorbol analogues for use in research, especially creating phorbol derivatives that can be used for anti-cancer activity.<ref name=Kawamura/>  Previously, the difficulty with synthesizing phorbol had been creating C-C bonds, especially in the 6 membered ring at the top of the molecule.  This synthesis starts from (+)-3-carene, and uses a series of 19 steps to eventually create (+) phorbol.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja00206a050| title = Studies on tumor promoters. 8.

==Uses in biomedical research and treatments==
Because of their mechanism of action, phorbol esters can be used to study tumor proliferation and pain response.  TPA is most commonly used in the laboratory to induce a cellular response.  For example, TPA can be used to measure response to pain and test compounds that may mitigate the inflammatory response.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Medeiros|first1=Rodrigo|last2=Otuki|first2=Michel F|last3=Avellar|first3=Maria Christina W|last4=Calixto|first4=João|title=Mechanisms underlying the inhibitory actions of the pentacyclic triterpene α-amyrin in the mouse skin inflammation induced by phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate|journal=European Journal of Pharmacology|date=March 2007|volume=22|issue=2-3|pages=227–235|doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2006.12.005}}</ref>  TPA and other phorbol esters can also be used to induce tumor formation and elucidate its mechanism.<ref name=Wang2015/>  Some phorbol esters have shown anti-cancer activities and can potentially be used as a defense against certain viruses and bacteria.<ref name=Wang2015/>  TPA, together with [[ionomycin]], can also be used to stimulate T-cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production, and is used in protocols for intracellular staining of these cytokines.<ref name="urlFlow Cytometry Intracellular Staining Guide">{{cite web | url = http://www.ebioscience.com/resources/best-protocols/flow-cytometry/flow-cytometry-intracellular-staining-quick-guide.htm | title = Flow Cytometry Intracellular Staining Guide | date = | work = | publisher = eBioscience, Inc. | accessdate = 2011-09-25 }}</ref>  Phorbol, in the form of croton oil, is also in folk medicine as a purgative, counter irritant, or [[anthelmintic]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Croton Oil|url=http://oilhealthbenefits.com/croton-oil/|website=OilHealthBenefits|publisher=OilHealthBenefits}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pal|first1=Prince Kumar|last2=Nandi|first2=Manmath Kumar|last3=Singh|first3=Narendra Kumar|title=Detoxification of Croton tiglium L. seeds by Ayurvedic process of Śodhana|journal=Ancient Science of Life|date=Jan–Mar 2014|volume=33|issue=3|pages=157–161|doi=10.4103/0257-7941.144619}}</ref>
